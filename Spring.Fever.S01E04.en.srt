00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,019
SPRING FEVER

2
00:00:55,873 --> 00:01:00,975
SPRING FEVER

3
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,901
{\an8}EPISODE 4

4
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:11,822
{\an8}You're right.

5
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,624
{\an8}I finally…

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,171
{\an8}remembered you.

7
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,013
{\an8}Remembered me?

8
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:37,848
{\an8}The <i>dakgalbi </i>place.

9
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,104
1 YEAR AGO

10
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,276
Eat up!

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,820
- Yes, boss!
- Yes, sir!

12
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:52,822
Thank you for the food!

13
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,865
Sir.

14
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,035
A bottle of soju, please.

15
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,703
Sure, just a second.

16
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:00,746
Okay.

17
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,333
Here you go.

18
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,586
I've never seen her before.

19
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,547
Maybe she's broken-hearted.

20
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,290
Geez.

21
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,502
Who eats <i>dakgalbi</i>
with their head down like that?

22
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,672
You shouldn't eat it like that.

23
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,134
You should sit up straight like this,

24
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,511
place this on your palm,

25
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:05,936
and top it with a slice of radish,
two pieces of meat,

26
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,063
and a piece of garlic on top.

27
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:10,733
Here.

28
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,693
Have it.

29
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,573
You country people are so nosy.

30
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,622
You're not from here, right?

31
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:26,957
Where are you from?

32
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,043
What's your name?

33
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,508
My name might not exist as of tomorrow.

34
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,558
"Beauty."

35
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,606
Then is that why you asked me to meet you?

36
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,155
Come to think of it,
the clothes you're wearing…

37
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,909
Yes, I was wearing this that day.

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,464
You're right. They're the same clothes.

39
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,967
I was actually thinking

40
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,428
you probably asked to see me
because you remembered.

41
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,138
Yes.

42
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,976
So that's why you wanted to see me.

43
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,231
To be honest,
I wanted to pretend not to remember.

44
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,902
Because you're my student's uncle
and I was embarrassed you had to see that.

45
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,196
But…

46
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:45,786
I thought about
why I kept letting you get to me.

47
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,038
And I realized

48
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,251
that I felt indebted to you
on a subconscious level.

49
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,256
And that might be the reason.

50
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,721
So, I wanted to settle that debt today.

51
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,734
And lastly…

52
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,611
Here.

53
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,382
Now I finally feel like I've repaid you.

54
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,969
I'm sorry I pretended not to remember.

55
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,182
And thank you

56
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,393
so much for that day.

57
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,105
Bye, then.

58
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,407
Were you trying to die,
or was it just an accident?

59
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,887
When you feel down,
sweets are the best cure. Okay?

60
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,650
What happened in Seoul?

61
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,154
Can you tell me about it?

62
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,994
Why would I tell you about me?

63
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,206
Who do you think you are?

64
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,125
Bom.

65
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:30,219
After spending some time with me,
you must think we're friends now.

66
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,763
Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

67
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,724
We're nothing like that.

68
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,647
So don't try to meddle in my business.

69
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,862
And just treat me
as your nephew's teacher.

70
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,574
Goodbye, then.

71
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,081
Ms. Bom.

72
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,833
Ms. Bom. Yoon…

73
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,630
SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL
SUN JAE-GYU

74
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,716
<i>What happened in Seoul?</i>

75
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,718
Can you tell me about it?

76
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,764
That was why
I wanted to pay my debt and end it.

77
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,466
There's nothing sweet
in this house, so go.

78
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,844
Just go. You won't?

79
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,436
What the heck? What's wrong with it?

80
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:02,913
Hide.

81
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,315
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

82
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,568
But what brought you to my place?

83
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,029
Oh. Well…

84
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:40,909
I dreamed of the perfect crime,
but it wasn't easy for a first-timer.

85
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,206
You went through a lot
because of my sister that day, so…

86
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,667
No, I just did my job as her teacher.

87
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,378
{\an8}Still, I should thank you as her brother.

88
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,088
{\an8}Thank me with luxury goods?

89
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,632
{\an8}No, it's just a shopping bag
for the brand.

90
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,474
Well, these are the only shopping bags
I have at my place.

91
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,318
Is it <i>baeksuk?</i>

92
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,159
You'll need my number.

93
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,538
Once you try it,
you'll definitely want to contact me.

94
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,434
BOM, I SHOULDN'T HAVE MEDDLED…

95
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,020
I apologize.

96
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,368
Is it the same girl?

97
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,913
Wow, you're texting each other now?

98
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,582
Any plans to get a new job?

99
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,963
I plan to work here
for the rest of my life.

100
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,048
Okay.

101
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:19,758
Wrap it up.

102
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,636
What? Where are you going?
You need to move these.

103
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,306
I feel so weak today,
I can't even lift a sheet of paper. Bye.

104
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,265
Why do you feel…

105
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,061
I plan to work here until I die!

106
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,647
SPORTS CENTER

107
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,871
The Shinsu High PE teacher
sure is different!

108
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:55,544
What is this? You veterans
can't even beat a newbie?

109
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,337
No one else?

110
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,674
Are there any more guys
who want to spar with me?

111
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,706
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

112
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,430
We're here to learn how to beat him
but might end up learning from him.

113
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,517
They say there's a bully at school.

114
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,727
No.

115
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,769
- Just be quiet.
- No.

116
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,897
He comes to the school,
acts rudely, and threatens them.

117
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,858
- Don't.
- They must've suffered so much

118
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:00,942
that they came here.

119
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,613
Ms. Seo, didn't you say
we had to go somewhere?

120
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,449
Well… Oh, right.

121
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,451
Someone we know is about to die.

122
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,495
- We should go to the funeral hall.
- Yes, we should hurry.

123
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,623
Still, you should spar with him.

124
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,710
The teachers have been waiting so long
to spar with you.

125
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,632
He treats his kid's teachers like that?

126
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,801
It's only right
to pull out his arm with an armbar

127
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,973
and finish him off
with the North-south choke.

128
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,481
But today I came to clear my head
because I feel off.

129
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,733
I'm sorry, but let's spar next time.

130
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,737
Goodness. That's too bad,
but we should take a rain check.

131
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,491
Let's do it.

132
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:56,164
What's gotten into him?
Why is he acting up so much today?

133
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,732
You're pretty good, huh?

134
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,946
Hey, do you know
a good burial spot for him?

135
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,281
May he rest in peace.

136
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,585
I got you. You punk.

137
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,171
Your arm will break. Tap out!

138
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,175
He's usually so strong.
Why is he so weak today?

139
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,052
- Punk.
- I know, right?

140
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,221
Hey, surrender. You'll break your arm.

141
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,852
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

142
00:16:58,935 --> 00:16:59,811
YOON BOM

143
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,482
What… Why is Ms. Bom calling at this hour?

144
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,782
Where are you going, punk?

145
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,706
Answer it.

146
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,711
Hi, Ms. Bom.

147
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,553
You didn't disclose the major flaws
of the house. That's deceiving.

148
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,974
You see, I let it slide
when grubs broke out in the yard.

149
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,852
This time, there are a lot wasps

150
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,855
flying around lately.
I can't live like this.

151
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,315
Wasps?

152
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:46,983
Wasps?

153
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,945
Well, if you want to get rid of wasps,

154
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,240
I think you should look
for an expert online.

155
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,543
We will draw lots to decide on teams
for the Shinsu High Sports Festival!

156
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,545
In this competition,

157
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,550
medals will be given to everyone
on the winning team. Yes or no?

158
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,219
- Yes!
- That's right.

159
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,845
Yes!

160
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,849
Now, second-year students,
please come up and draw lots.

161
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,059
Come on up!

162
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,979
GOOD AT EVERYTHING
SUN HAN-GYUL

163
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,356
{\an8}Han-gyul!

164
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,989
Team White!

165
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,407
SO HANDSOME, SUN HAN-GYUL

166
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,205
{\an8}Team White!

167
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,088
Team Blue!

168
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,012
Team Blue!

169
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,017
Team White!

170
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:07,188
Ms. Bom, I was looking into some app
because of the wasps

171
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,274
and found someone really good.

172
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,441
Here, have a read.

173
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,193
Team Blue!

174
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,403
What is that?

175
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,823
"Hello. I'm the Song Joong-ki of Shinsu,

176
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,158
the youngest son of a rich family."

177
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,077
"I'd like to introduce myself briefly."

178
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,540
<i>"When I was a baby, I learned to crawl
watching cockroaches crawling."</i>

179
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,459
<i>"Battling ants over my meals</i>

180
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,378
<i>and waging bloody wars with mosquitoes</i>

181
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:34,215
<i>turned me into something
of an insecticide expert,</i>

182
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,511
<i>especially when it comes
to dealing with wasps."</i>

183
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,557
<i>"I've never been able
to stand nectar-sucking insects,</i>

184
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,184
<i>so I took out wasps whenever I saw them."</i>

185
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,521
<i>"People even joked,
'Is he from a beekeeper family or what?'"</i>

186
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,107
<i>"'Why is he so good
at getting rid of wasps?'"</i>

187
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,944
<i>"Hence, I ended up earning the title
'The Heir of the Wasp Family.'"</i>

188
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,572
<i>"Is there a wasp nest at your house?"</i>

189
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,741
<i>"Did you get stung by a wasp today?"</i>

190
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,535
"If so, please contact me,
the Heir of the Wasp Family."

191
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,953
"For just 20,000 won,

192
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:08,166
I will take care of everything."
"No sticky hands guaranteed"?

193
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,500
What do you think?

194
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,462
Doesn't he sound legit?

195
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,547
- He's the real deal.
- "An heir."

196
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,257
Next up are Ms. Seo Hye-suk

197
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,259
and Ms. Yoon Bom. Please come up.

198
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,137
All right. What will they draw?

199
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,140
Let's go.

200
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,268
Team Blue!

201
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,438
Next, Ms. Yoon Bom.

202
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,401
Team White!

203
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,655
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

204
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,117
Take a look.
It looks like a Korean food buffet.

205
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,580
Team Blue only has overly fermented
green onion kimchi and pickles.

206
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,378
<i>Bom, don't listen to him.
Don't say anything or get angry.</i>

207
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,921
Pickles?

208
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:59,425
You're the one who's wrinkly like
dried fish. Who are you calling pickles?

209
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,177
I wasn't talking about you.

210
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,345
That doesn't matter.

211
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,429
Calm down.

212
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:07,767
The Superintendent of Education
and the governor might come that day.

213
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,853
I think Mr. Hong's making a fuss
because he'd look bad to them.

214
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,023
<i>Put up with injustice.</i>

215
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,900
Come on, don't be like that.

216
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,404
To make it fair,
let us swap team members, just one.

217
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,907
<i>Restrain yourself
from saying what's right.</i>

218
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,286
Well, I don't know.
I can't just tell them to swap teams.

219
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,664
Unless someone wants to switch teams.

220
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,582
Ms. Bom.

221
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,876
You volunteer to switch teams.

222
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,462
What are you saying?

223
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:38,923
Why would I…

224
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,843
Wait, Mr. Hong.

225
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,349
YOON BOM

226
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:53,730
Mr. Hong.

227
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,981
YOON

228
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,491
Where on earth did the white ball go?

229
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,494
How could he change the decision
like that?

230
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,831
Why not change the World Cup
draw results while he's at it?

231
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,295
How should I take revenge on him?

232
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,506
Do I have to join Team Blue
if you tell me to?

233
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,079
Open up.

234
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,626
- It's good.
- Really?

235
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,546
Get better after eating this, okay?

236
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,406
Congrats on passing
the teacher certification exam.

237
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,665
Your <i>baeksuk </i>is the best.

238
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,916
Yay!

239
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,107
How does it taste the same
as my dad's <i>baeksuk?</i>

240
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,115
Once you try it,
you'll definitely want to contact me.

241
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,330
{\an8}LAWYER CHOI I-JUN

242
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,007
Right.

243
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,474
Coming.

244
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,612
The Heir of the Wasp Family, right?

245
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:07,924
This way, please.

246
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,570
See the tree with "Sun Jae-gyu" on it?

247
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,489
I think that's the cause.

248
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,909
You see, I've never watered it properly.

249
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,371
Because I don't really care
whether it lives or dies.

250
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,040
But it's so resilient.

251
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,710
Every time I see it, it's grown.
Just like the person who gave it.

252
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:51,092
I saw on the Internet that people usually
use gasoline or lacquer spray.

253
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,386
How will you get rid of it with an axe?

254
00:25:55,972 --> 00:26:01,269
If you're worried about the tree,
I don't care if it breaks or gets hurt.

255
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,520
So don't worry.

256
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,490
Is it done already?

257
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,244
I'll go get my wallet.
It's 20,000 won, right?

258
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,665
I'm not that kind of person.

259
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,543
I'm sure you've suffered
because of insects all your life.

260
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,295
Of course I should pay you.

261
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,428
By any chance,

262
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,848
could you take care of that one as well?

263
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,060
I think it'll be infested with bugs soon,

264
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,687
so I'd like to deal with it
if the price is right.

265
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,193
You mean 20,000 won?

266
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,612
Please do it right away.

267
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,305
Sir, take a break and have this.

268
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,641
How many grains are in it?

269
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:17,363
What a good worker.

270
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,035
If I'd known there was

271
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,122
such a good worker who works so quietly,

272
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,082
I would've called for help sooner.

273
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:33,629
It's him.

274
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,632
Mr. Choi I-jun.

275
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,051
Thank you for the <i>baeksuk.</i>

276
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,804
I couldn't help but call you,
like you said.

277
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,557
It tastes exactly
like what I was looking for.

278
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,893
Especially the bittersweet aftertaste.

279
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,230
No restaurant has recreated that taste.

280
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,986
Seriously? You'll give me
the secret recipe?

281
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,573
Okay. Then, at 5:00 p.m. on the 24th,

282
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,616
I'll see you at Two Cups of Coffee.

283
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,416
Heave-ho!

284
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,344
"Heave-ho"?

285
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,016
So…

286
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,649
His uncle is...
the Heir of the Wasp Family?

287
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,742
Did you finish it?
Anything you don't understand?

288
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,411
There is.

289
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,079
Why won't you ask me?

290
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,374
Because I wouldn't teach you
if I were you.

291
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,335
You got me wrong.

292
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,797
I wouldn't lose to you
even if I taught you a little.

293
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,300
Is that so?

294
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,469
Then teach me.

295
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,434
Let's not calculate them one by one
and just list them.

296
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,229
Sigma k from one to ten…

297
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,606
K cubed equals…

298
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,858
Two-tenths…

299
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,364
It's 3,025.

300
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,055
I knew it.

301
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,140
What are you doing?

302
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,101
I knew you weren't athletic.

303
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,688
Team White's captain, Evil Han-gyul.

304
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,734
Have you ever seen me laugh?

305
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:28,614
You'll see it at the sports festival.

306
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,534
Because I will crush you.

307
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,790
Let's take a photo together that day.

308
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,461
I want to capture
my victorious smile next to a loser.

309
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,434
It was so hot.

310
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:01,480
Well,

311
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:05,567
I disguised myself perfectly.
How did you know?

312
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,698
Who would have dragon tattoos on their arm
except for you, Mr. Sun Jae-gyu?

313
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,412
I happened to overhear Ms. Seo
talking to you on the phone.

314
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,622
I thought you needed help.

315
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,126
I told you to stay out of my business.

316
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,044
Are you a stalker?

317
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,715
Stalkers follow people around
to hurt them.

318
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,925
I wanted to help you.

319
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,094
Look.

320
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,848
I got rid of the wasps and chopped down
the tree. Is that so wrong?

321
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,766
An unwanted approach is rude.

322
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,976
I…

323
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,899
I thought I made you upset,
so I wanted to make you feel better.

324
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,569
Unwanted help is just a pain.

325
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,614
"A pain"?

326
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,161
Did you just say "a pain"?

327
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,414
It's 40,000 won, right?

328
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,502
The way out is that way.

329
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,387
I was actually going to leave soon, okay?

330
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:18,515
There are so many people
asking for my services.

331
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,976
Goodness.

332
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,270
I really might end up being rich!

333
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,358
She has no idea how I feel.

334
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,908
He knocked someone down yesterday.

335
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,161
Who's he going to beat up today?

336
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,332
He should've understood when I told him.

337
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,959
Why did he come here again?

338
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,256
Draw the line, Bom.

339
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,175
He's your student's uncle.

340
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,567
I really enjoyed it.

341
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,820
I know it's bad manners
to give the container back empty,

342
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,488
but I have nothing to give you.

343
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:57,865
The coffee's on me.

344
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,874
This café's identity is…

345
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:12,671
Coffee, <i>ssanghwa </i>tea and pumpkin porridge.

346
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,551
It's like a combination
of traditional music and hip-hop.

347
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,513
I like coffee with acidity,
like Ethiopian Sidamo

348
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,140
or Kenya AA.

349
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,727
But every café in this area uses Robusta.

350
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,772
If you like coffee with acidity,
there's Camil Coffee on Rodeo Street.

351
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,983
What? That's my favorite coffee shop.

352
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,235
Have you tried their signature?

353
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:36,862
Orange Einspänner.

354
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,785
Here's your pumpkin porridge.

355
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:50,792
You didn't even try this. This place's
signature is pumpkin porridge.

356
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,636
By the way,
you're not asking the question.

357
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,346
Sorry?

358
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,222
What question?

359
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:08,435
Well, there's this question
everyone here asks me.

360
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,812
"Why did you come down here?"

361
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,606
"What happened in Seoul?"

362
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,316
Because some things

363
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,277
are painful just to bring up.

364
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:21,657
Country people,

365
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,661
they always cross the line.
They have no sense of boundaries.

366
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:30,958
They meddle when they show interest
and interrogate when they ask questions.

367
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,462
I feel like the thoughts in my head

368
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,923
just came out of your mouth.

369
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,803
What people like us need most
is graceful indifference.

370
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,004
I'm so pathetic.

371
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,757
Why did I even go there to listen to them?

372
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,303
But, son...

373
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,515
I'm old-fashioned,

374
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,851
so if I like someone, I show it,

375
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,187
and if they need help, I help them.
That's all I know.

376
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:39,693
This line that Seoul people talk about,
I have no idea where it lies.

377
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,237
Bom-sik, what about you?

378
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,200
Do you know what graceful indifference is?

379
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,869
Do you know

380
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:52,581
any way to make up with your mom
without crossing the line?

381
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,420
Say something, Bom-sik.

382
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:26,740
Seriously, did Bom finish it all?

383
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,077
Now that the delivery's complete,
please tell me.

384
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,790
How did you
lose contact with your daughter?

385
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,882
I'll sue them.

386
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:48,595
The parents are in the wrong.
Why did I have to be humiliated like that?

387
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,305
Don't.

388
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,768
Mom.

389
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,188
What did you... just say?

390
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,067
Before you're a teacher,
you're Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

391
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:06,822
"The adulterous teacher is Jeong Nan-hee's
daughter." "A scandal with a married man."

392
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,158
If such articles get published,
who will take the blow?

393
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,120
Mom, you're only thinking
about yourself in this situation?

394
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,082
Right now, this is
the only way to prove my innocence.

395
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,001
You think people are interested
in your innocence?

396
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,296
What they're interested in
is not the truth, it's gossip.

397
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,595
Dad.

398
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,851
What needs to be done needs to be done.

399
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,895
I don't want to bury this.

400
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:41,106
Once it's buried, it's tough to dig it up.

401
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:46,653
I'll end up… living as a teacher
who had an affair with a parent.

402
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,571
Please?

403
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,365
Bom.

404
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,285
Is it…

405
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,289
really not true?

406
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,338
<i>I didn't say that just for my sake.</i>

407
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,174
It would've been worse for Bom.

408
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,677
Because she is the daughter
of celebrity, Jeong Nan-hee,

409
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,555
it would've been
exaggerated and distorted.

410
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,642
Even still, she's your daughter.

411
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,770
I shouldn't have done that
to Bom back then.

412
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,566
Speaking of which…

413
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,240
What is all this?

414
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,661
The evidence Bom gathered
to file a lawsuit.

415
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,084
{\an8}Now that we've found Bom,

416
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,004
{\an8}I want to move ahead
with the lawsuit again.

417
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,008
{\an8}I believe it's the only way
for us to make up with her.

418
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:54,971
Attorney Choi, can you help us this once?

419
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,312
TEAM BLUE'S PARENTS

420
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,483
TEAM WHITE'S PARENTS

421
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:10,904
PARENT-TEACHER MEETING

422
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:15,367
You know that the teachers and students
are divided into two teams, right?

423
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,618
- Yes.
- Yes.

424
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,869
Principal.

425
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,248
I think there's someone here
who's not an official member.

426
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,374
Pardon?

427
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,293
I think it's me.

428
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,552
I'm Choi I-jun, the older brother
of Choi Se-jin, a second-year student.

429
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,765
It would've been appropriate
for my parents to come,

430
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,017
but they're busy with the inauguration,

431
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,104
so I came on their behalf.

432
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,941
"On their behalf"?
This isn't some neighborhood meeting.

433
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:56,491
I've reviewed
the parent-teacher meeting regulations,

434
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,576
and this doesn't violate any legally.

435
00:42:59,077 --> 00:42:59,995
As it happens,

436
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,413
{\an8}SCHOOL RULES AND POLICIES

437
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,498
I'm a lawyer.

438
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,255
First thing,

439
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:14,175
is there a volunteer to be the leader
of the parents on Team White?

440
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,226
Bom-sik, Mom's here.

441
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,644
- Hello.
- Hello.

442
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,021
You came.

443
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,147
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

444
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,858
Bom-sik.

445
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,033
What?

446
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,911
Gosh, it was here.

447
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,164
I must've left it here last time.

448
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,958
Bom-sik, this is the ball I drew.

449
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,460
Do you want it?

450
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,711
- Do you?
- Team White.

451
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:55,258
You see, Mommy came up with a plan
to win for sure at the sports festival.

452
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:07,187
Okay. Then I'll win at all costs
and get the medal for you, Bom-sik.

453
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,396
You trust me, right?

454
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,277
<i>I'll do it.</i>

455
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,865
Any objections?

456
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:25,038
All right. The leader for Team White
has now been decided.

457
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,208
What about Team Blue?
Who will be the leader?

458
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,672
I'll do it.

459
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:38,385
Se-jin told me that you're on Team Blue.

460
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,512
I am on Team Blue, but…

461
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:44,474
Se-jin seemed so determined
to win this sports festival.

462
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,601
I'm as determined as she is.

463
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,605
The medal will be around my neck
when it ends, no matter what.

464
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,240
Oh, my. It's been decided so quickly.

465
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,200
Okay, that's final.

466
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:03,535
Now, you two,

467
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,788
why don't you come forward
and shake hands?

468
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,003
Come closer.

469
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:49,038
All right. Exercising is
all about stamina.

470
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,166
At this sports festival,

471
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,210
the tug-of-war will draw
the most attention,

472
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:56,463
and stamina will determine the winner.

473
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,757
Make sure everyone's ready, okay?

474
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:00,925
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

475
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:01,926
INSTRUCTOR

476
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,178
Uncle.

477
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,596
Do we have to go this far?

478
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,097
Yes, we do.

479
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,308
I mean, we're supposed to enjoy the day.

480
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,893
Must we do this to win?

481
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,978
Yes. All right.

482
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:18,359
Competition might be painful,
but it brings you great achievements.

483
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,029
And through this sports festival,

484
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,156
all of you will learn that lesson.

485
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,575
Who wants to learn that here?

486
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:27,869
Can't you see they're sleepy?

487
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,628
Are you sleepy?

488
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,046
No, sir!

489
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,923
All right, everyone open your eyes!

490
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,258
You can sleep when you're dead.

491
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,763
Now, everyone grab the rope
in front of you.

492
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,642
Move faster!

493
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,522
After the training,
I'll check your breath.

494
00:46:56,105 --> 00:47:00,527
If I smell toothpaste from your mouth,
it means you haven't trained properly.

495
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,738
From now on,
until your breath smells like anchovies,

496
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,698
pull the rope. Understood?

497
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,158
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

498
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,245
Pull!

499
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,829
Pull!

500
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:13,748
Hey, pull!

501
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,416
Pull!

502
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,171
Pull!

503
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,428
Pull!

504
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,604
Pull harder! Team White!

505
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,107
{\an8}Let's say their weight is 1,000 kg

506
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,569
{\an8}and our weight is 900 kg.

507
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,280
If they stand in a single line...

508
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,324
and we stand in two lines,

509
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,161
since their 1,000 kg force
will be pulled diagonally--

510
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,079
Sir.

511
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,457
Why do we have to know this?

512
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,587
General Kang Kam-chan once said

513
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,632
that force is always defeated by wisdom.

514
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:08,845
You and the general must not know this
since you've never lost in your life.

515
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,847
If you give up, your life gets easier.

516
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:14,100
I'm sure you're all hungry.
Let's just go eat.

517
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,395
Mattis Donuts!

518
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,701
Aren't those the Mattis Donuts
that went viral on Instar?

519
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,786
They're hard to get, even in Seoul.

520
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,705
How long will you eat nothing but rice?

521
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,345
This rich cream and soft, fluffy pastry.

522
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,681
Behold. This is the taste of Seoul.

523
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:02,440
Students who attend the strategy meeting

524
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,984
will be provided
with a different dessert every time.

525
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:06,694
And if Team Blue wins,

526
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:12,158
the best salt bread
from Eclani in Seonggu-dong

527
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,534
will be given to you.

528
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,286
Hooray for Team Blue!

529
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,997
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

530
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:20,416
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

531
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,044
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

532
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,587
- Team Blue!
- Team Blue!

533
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,947
Did you get the tissues ready?

534
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:55,118
You'll end up weeping and sniffling.
You'll need boxes of them.

535
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,079
Prepare wet wipes if possible.

536
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,291
Blowing your nose with tissues
will make your nose chafe.

537
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:11,676
Me?

538
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:18,933
Hey.

539
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,102
Did you encourage him?

540
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,437
What do you mean?

541
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,023
Because I said I'd beat you,
you dragged your uncle into this.

542
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:29,819
My uncle and I have never talked
about the sports festival.

543
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:32,447
Then why is your uncle
so passionate about it?

544
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,324
I mean,

545
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:40,121
isn't it unfair for your uncle
to participate in the sports festival?

546
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,916
It's like a professional Go player
competing against an amateur

547
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,085
or a pop star
competing against an amateur.

548
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:48,004
I admit that,

549
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,424
but my uncle doesn't change his mind
once he decides on something.

550
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,135
I tried to stop him many times today,

551
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,511
but it didn't work at all.

552
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,473
- You tried to stop him?
- I did.

553
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:07,273
You know...

554
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,067
You have a way of confusing me.

555
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:16,282
Sometimes it feels like
you're trying to screw me over,

556
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,327
and sometimes like
you're trying to help me.

557
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,582
Which one is it?

558
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,085
Good or evil?

559
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,969
Bom-sik. Good dog.

560
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:39,430
Bom-sik, let's play.

561
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,023
Good dog.

562
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,566
Yes! Good dog!

563
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,026
Gosh, you're like a person.

564
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,611
You're human now.

565
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,031
Good job.
Bom-sik, you're a genius, aren't you?

566
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,908
Good job, my baby.

567
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,963
Bom-sik, Mommy's busy
with preparations for the sports festival,

568
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,632
so I'll get going. Tell him that for me.

569
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:19,262
Can you ask her
if she sees any more wasps?

570
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:23,432
Well, I don't see any now.

571
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,019
And ask her what happened
to the grubs in the yard.

572
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,771
They're gone too.

573
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,404
Your dad may lack sensibility
and be tacky in some ways,

574
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,074
but when he does something,
he gets it done. Tell her that.

575
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:45,454
Ask him if he wants me
to say thank you, then.

576
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,957
I'm not saying I want to hear that,

577
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,502
but I don't want her to get me wrong.
Tell her that.

578
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:01,721
Here.

579
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,472
This is

580
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,809
the money your dad earned
working part-time. It's for you.

581
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:12,064
Seoul people may feel comfortable
with setting the bill so accurately,

582
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:16,110
but people here
feel so uncomfortable with it.

583
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,529
Bom-sik, use it for your snacks.

584
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,247
Your dad is the leader
of the parents on Team White.

585
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:32,418
I will win at all costs
and get you the medal, Bom-sik.

586
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,836
You can look forward to it.

587
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,504
Okay?

588
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:41,677
I'm off.

589
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,756
SHINSU HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS FESTIVAL

590
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,801
{\an8}FIGHT AND WIN!
TEAM WHITE! LET'S GO!

591
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,469
TEAM WHITE
TEAM BLUE

592
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,680
PERFECT LIKE A GOD!
SUN HAN-GYUL!

593
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,848
OUR HERO!
SUN HAN-GYUL, LET'S GO!

594
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:57,586
What is it?

595
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,883
- Uncle.
- What?

596
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:06,846
What is it?

597
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,437
Do you want something from me?

598
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,397
You want more allowance?

599
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,650
Can you not come to...

600
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:21,777
the sports festival?

601
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,198
What?

602
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,620
You've been acting strange.

603
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,582
Why do you keep complaining
about the sports fest?

604
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:38,753
And you? Why are you so desperate to win?
You even trained the kids.

605
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,216
Isn't it such a good opportunity?

606
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,428
Kids these days don't move much
since they study all the time.

607
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:52,433
They get to improve their stamina
and learn to work as a team, and…

608
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:53,434
And?

609
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,811
And, you know…

610
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,648
Your homeroom teacher wants to win.

611
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:00,775
What?

612
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,945
If she wins, she'll feel good.

613
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,323
If she feels good, she'll teach you better

614
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:10,659
and take better care
of you and your classmates.

615
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,454
If you want her to win,
you shouldn't participate.

616
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:15,498
What do you mean?

617
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,375
She's... on Team Blue.

618
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:19,418
Gosh.

619
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,378
She's on Team White.

620
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,421
She's on Team Blue.

621
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:24,131
She's on Team White, you punk.

622
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:27,510
I saw her holding a white ball
with my own eyes.

623
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,428
But it changed.

624
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,348
What changed?

625
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,391
Se-jin saw it in the teachers' office.

626
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:38,562
Hong Jung-pyo put her on his team,
saying his team was too weak.

627
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,149
Because both Ms. Bom and Se-jin
are on Team Blue,

628
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:43,734
Se-jin's brother's making a fuss.

629
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:50,032
Uncle.

630
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,829
I don't care whether we win
the stupid sports festival or not,

631
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,247
so don't participate.

632
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,624
So that she can win. Okay?

633
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,294
You won't, right? Right?

634
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,880
- Let go of me.
- Why?

635
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,730
Sir! We gathered
and pulled the tire again yesterday.

636
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,859
Do you want to smell my breath?
It's brutal.

637
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:30,865
Good job.

638
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,285
Everyone, keep your eyes open!

639
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,121
You can sleep when you're dead.

640
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,129
Well, you know, sufficient sleep

641
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:48,757
is essential for students
who are still growing.

642
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:54,346
Excessive competition
is what ails this era,

643
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,517
and participation
is more important than winning.

644
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:03,147
So don't be obsessed with winning,

645
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,273
and just enjoy it.

646
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,817
Okay? Good.

647
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:07,735
Master.

648
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,987
I think your pep talk has changed a bit.

649
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,782
Why aren't you wearing our team T-shirt?

650
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,972
ONE HEART SPORTS FESTIVAL

651
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:47,650
Choi I-jun.

652
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:52,655
In tug-of-war,
you should use your legs, not your arms.

653
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:53,781
Okay?

654
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,952
Embrace your core until the match ends,

655
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,372
and pull with all your might
with your hip and thigh muscles.

656
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,581
Understand?

657
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:08,712
What do you think?

658
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,048
What do you mean?

659
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:16,136
Isn't this place nice and quiet
for us to take a picture later?

660
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:19,932
That's if I win.

661
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:23,018
You asked me last time

662
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:28,148
if my intentions were good or evil.

663
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:29,858
So?

664
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:34,697
Once the sports festival ends,
you'll know the answer.

665
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,326
I won't participate.

666
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,247
Don't be ridiculous.

667
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,959
If I participate,
I'll join the military again.

668
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,629
I'll only eat vegetables
at barbecue places,

669
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,799
and I'll call you "honey"
for the rest of my life.

670
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:54,925
Believe me now?

671
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:56,802
Why the sudden change of heart?

672
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,725
So win no matter what, okay?

673
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:04,768
Team Blue.

674
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,228
Good luck.

675
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,108
The homeroom teacher's here!

676
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,176
Why would I…

677
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,268
Gosh, it was here.

678
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,192
I am on Team Blue, but…

679
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:16,799
Team White?

680
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:18,592
Team White?

681
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,141
Team White, are you ready to win?

682
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,601
Let's go!

683
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:03,434
SPRING FEVER

684
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,518
{\an8}Use your legs!

685
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,146
{\an8}<i>I need you, Mr. Sun.</i>

686
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,313
{\an8}Please?

687
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,107
{\an8}<i>I'm just as upset.</i>

688
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:17,443
{\an8}Who are you?

689
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,945
{\an8}I'm here to see Mr. Sun Jae-gyu.

690
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,531
{\an8}Her smile. That's all I want to see.

691
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,324
{\an8}It's the same for me.

692
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,162
It's all done, Bom-sik's house.

693
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,455
<i>I love you.</i>

694
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,252
