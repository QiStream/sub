00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,541
Chen Yumo, a local from Yunxi City.

4
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,020
Ten years ago, you were gang-raped.

5
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,461
Afterward, your whole family moved away.

6
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,821
Five years later,
your parents died in a car accident,

7
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,860
and you returned to Yunxi.

8
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:04,780
(Dan Qing/Chen Yumo Profile)

9
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,780
You met Huo at the nightclub.

10
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:08,940
(Dan Qing/Chen Yumo Profile)
Then you went to the border.

11
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,621
When the rape happened,

12
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:13,021
you were only 16 years old.

13
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:16,581
You had a boyfriend.

14
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,861
He was your classmate
at Experimental High School.

15
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,741
His name was Ye Qian.

16
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:24,341
(And that Ye Qian is now a cop.)

17
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:04,100
Xiang.

18
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,660
It's our first deal.

19
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,141
Mr. Bao wants to be cautious.

20
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:12,901
We all understand that.

21
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,660
But if just because

22
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,380
an ex-boyfriend

23
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,672
she barely remembers became a cop

24
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,660
makes you question us,

25
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,700
it makes Mr. Bao's reputation

26
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,220
seem pretty overrated.

27
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,100
You say she doesn't remember her ex?

28
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:40,220
Then why did he go looking for her
at that hotel you used?

29
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:43,741
Who says I don't remember him?

30
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:45,100
I remember him.

31
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,021
I'll remember him till death.

32
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,141
If I hadn't been with him...

33
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,260
Stop beating around the bush.

34
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,660
What do you want?

35
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:58,660
Prove your sincerity.

36
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,901
Prove she's

37
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,100
not a cop.

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,901
Go tell Mr. Bao.

39
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,061
If he doesn't trust me,
we don't have to work together.

40
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,741
This is

41
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,500
unnecessary.

42
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,500
Take Madman with you.

43
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,820
Xiang.

44
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,421
I've got a video here.

45
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,940
- I'd like to share it with you.
- Run? Come back.

46
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,621
Boss.

47
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,020
I know I was wrong.

48
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Please let me go.

49
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,181
You want to die?

50
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,500
Tighter.

51
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:58,661
Run? Get back here.

52
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,380
Boss!

53
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,661
I know I was wrong.

54
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:01,781
Please let me go.

55
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,500
Boss, I know I was wrong.

56
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,861
I'll never do it again.

57
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,301
Well done, Dan Qing.

58
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:16,460
Okay.

59
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,500
Got it.

60
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,460
All four are dead?

61
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,500
You can check for yourself.

62
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,700
They're probably just listed as missing.

63
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,301
As our boss just said,

64
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:39,781
us meeting like this is fate,
a rare chance.

65
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,221
So how about this?

66
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:44,700
Let your girlfriend

67
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,020
keep in touch with her ex-boyfriend.

68
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,900
After all, in our line of work,

69
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,421
good relations with the cops can't hurt.

70
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,820
Buried where?

71
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,421
Give me the location.

72
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:10,541
Xiang.

73
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:15,221
Send someone unrelated to this location.

74
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,020
Take pictures.

75
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,301
Understood.

76
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,301
Just a moment.

77
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
One order of wontons.

78
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,940
Sure.

79
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:56,940
- Okay.
- No spice.

80
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,940
No chili peppers.

81
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,900
Just a second.

82
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,580
Okay.

83
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,421
Add some greens.

84
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,460
Got it.

85
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:04,380
Hello?

86
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,181
Where are you with the takeout?

87
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:07,861
I'm starving.

88
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,020
Bag snatcher!

89
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:17,541
Move! Get out of the way!

90
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,460
Move!

91
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:44,061
Looking for trouble, huh?

92
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,340
Stay back!

93
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:53,301
I'll kill you!

94
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,860
Make way.

95
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,381
Coming through.

96
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,620
What happened?

97
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,661
City CID.

98
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,781
Thanks for your help.

99
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,901
We'll take it from here.

100
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
Officers,

101
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,580
they're the ones who snatched my bag.

102
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:20,980
Alright, come with us.

103
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,620
Take them away.

104
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:14,488
(Interview Room)

(Ye Qian's Profile)

106
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:47,860
Dan Qing,

107
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,541
still tailing them?

108
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,021
Yes.

109
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,620
Didn't you grab the keys?

110
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:52,261
What took you so long?

111
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,781
You could have crawled back by now.

112
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,381
What brings you here?

113
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,740
Quick, come in.

114
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,781
- Where's Little Qian?
- Hotpot delivery?

115
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,421
He went to get the takeout.

116
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:05,940
If I'd known you were coming,

117
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,340
I wouldn't have told him to go.

118
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,580
Don't flatter yourself.

119
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,620
I am not treating you.

120
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,220
Don't say that.

121
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:12,740
You've brought so much.

122
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,421
It'd be wasteful
not to finish it, right?

123
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:16,141
What are you waiting for?

124
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,061
Set it up.

125
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:17,740
Right away.

126
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,381
Give Little Qian a call.

127
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:23,261
Ask him where he is.

128
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,381
He's been gone forever.

129
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,460
I won't.

130
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,021
If he knows I'm here,
he'll find an excuse to bolt again.

131
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:28,740
You call.

132
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,580
I just did.

133
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,700
He didn't answer.

134
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:33,940
No need to call. He's back.

135
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:37,940
Dad? Mom?

136
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:38,980
What a surprise!

137
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,580
Give me that.

138
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,421
Come on in.

139
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,340
Should've told me.
I could've picked you up.

140
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,460
Do we need an appointment?

141
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:46,552
This is...

142
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,704
Let me introduce you.

143
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:49,980
This is my good friend, Han Zhao.

144
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,460
And these are my parents.

145
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,820
Hello, ma'am, sir.

146
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,661
Hello.

147
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:54,541
Long,

148
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,781
where's your roommate?

149
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:58,021
The tall, slim, fair-skinned one?

150
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,740
He went to get the takeout.

151
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,820
He should be back soon.

152
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,620
Sit down.

153
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,940
Mom, I'll get you a chair.

154
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,501
Sir, have a seat.

155
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,240
Okay.

156
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:06,980
Long,

157
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,021
how is this place still such a mess?

158
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:10,940
I need to tidy up for you later.

159
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,061
Please don't tidy up for me.

160
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:13,940
You did it last time,

161
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,340
and then I couldn't find anything.

162
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,061
Just sit down and enjoy your meal.

163
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,860
Look at you, then look at Ye.

164
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:20,421
How is he so neat and tidy?

165
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,820
What sauce? Sesame paste?

166
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,501
I'll mix one for you.

167
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,501
Anything's fine.

168
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,141
These foods look so fancy.

169
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:28,980
I'm so sorry.

170
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,781
We didn't know Long had company.

171
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,220
We wouldn't have come to intrude.

172
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,501
It's fine.

173
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,381
I brought plenty of food.

174
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,820
Let's just eat together.

175
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,781
Han, right?

176
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,580
How old are you?

177
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,061
What do you do?

178
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,261
She owns a restaurant.

179
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,901
A high-end one.

180
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:51,781
Running a restaurant is no easy job.

181
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,820
It's manageable.

182
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,021
When Long was little,

183
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:55,501
he wanted to open a restaurant too.

184
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,220
That's quite a coincidence.

185
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,181
Eat.

186
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:00,740
You have no chopsticks.

187
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,421
I'll get you a pair.

188
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:09,860
Do your parents misunderstand something?

189
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,860
Clear things up.

190
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,901
Probably not.

191
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,381
Maybe they just think you're pretty.

192

If they are mistaken,

193
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,381
just deal with it.

194
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:19,181

195
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,460

It's fine, sir.

It's just a quick drive.

Is it easy to fix?

244
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,100
I need to open it up to see.

245
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,660
If it's good,

246
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
I can bore the cylinders
and replace the pistons.

If it's serious,

that He Changchun
is fleeing the province.

Captain Liao is rushing here now.

270

The roads around Linshui
are very complex.

Manpower and time are both issues.

272
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:52,900
True.

273
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,580
If we canvass the area
and launch a manhunt,

274
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,820
the efficiency will be low.

275

276
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,580
and chooses to flee on foot,

the piston rings and valve seals.

347
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,941
He Changchun is driving east.

348
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,701
The owner is out. Get an ambulance.

349
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,100
How's your hand?

350
00:31:56,876 --> 00:31:59,224
(Yunxi Police Department)

351
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:08,140
Have some water.

352
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,340
Thanks. I was starving.

353
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,660
You're fed and watered?

354
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,580
Let's talk?

355
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,420
This bag is yours, right?

356
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:34,180
And this knife?

357
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:35,981
It's mine.

358
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,261
My parents.

359
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:50,701
Why kill He Hongqing's whole family?

360
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,261
They bullied us.

361
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:56,420
Explain it in detail.

362
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,061
Okay.

363
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:01,541
Let me tell you.

364
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,180
That year,

365
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,860
my grandpa was very ill.

366
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,221
He called all his children
to divide the farmland.

367
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,820
- My dad saw his dilemma.
- Little Qian.

368
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,104
He let the others pick first.

369
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:14,941
I can't open it.

370
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:16,420
He ended up with the worst plot.

371
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,820
I spent three months
clearing rocks from that land

372
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,856
before planting anything.

373
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,461
The next year,

374
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,221
- during harvest...
- Thanks.

375
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,061
Good thing your tendon wasn't injured.

376
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,420
- Long.
- My uncle, He Shanxiang...

377
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,860
Don't be so reckless next time.

378
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:35,580
He brought a group to corner my dad

379
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:37,900
and demanded those five acres back.

380
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:39,941
They said Grandpa was senile,

381
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:40,701
so it didn't count.

382
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,541
My dad argued with them,

383
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:43,701
and they beat him up.

384
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,301
Yet my dad stayed silent
when he came home.

385
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:51,061
Soon after, he died of anger.

386
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,541
(The irony is,)

387
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:55,900
(they refused to bury him
in the He family graves.)

388
00:33:57,941 --> 00:33:59,221
I wouldn't stand for it then.

389
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,820
But I still had my mom.

390
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:06,264
She struggled to keep
the family together and raise me.

391
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,741
But then,

392
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,501
they came to our place
on Chinese New Year's Eve

393
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:12,740
(and smashed everything they could.)

394
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,220
(Mom fainted on the spot.)

395
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:17,016
(At the hospital, they found cancer.)

396
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,021
This year,

397
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,740
my uncle's family
joined the village co-op

398
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,821
for land transfers.

399
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:28,220
They brought a land lease contract
to the hospital

400
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,061
to trick my mom into signing.

401
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,220
They harassed her over and over.

402
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:34,341
Eventually, my mom
couldn't take it and died.

403
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,580
The doctor said that

404
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,461
had she not been so pressed,

405
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:40,220
she might've lived another year or two.

406
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm the youngest in our generation.

407
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,780
They always bullied me growing up.

408
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,861
I'd run home crying,

409
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,061
and my dad would say,

410
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:53,660
"They're family."

411
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,180
"They're fond of you

412
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,541
and playing with you."

413
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:59,861
My dad never fought back.

414
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,140
He endured it his whole life

415
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:03,620
until he was gone.

416
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,180
My mom endured it too,

417
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:06,821
and now she's gone too.

418
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,061
Now it's just me left.

419
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,381
I wanted to fight back.

420
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,461
Just this once.

421
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,501
Officer.

422
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,620
Do you think I was wrong?

423
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,780
Of course you were wrong.

424
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,461
Why did you hurt more people?

425
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,620
That traffic cop

426
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:35,341
suspected the motorcycle wasn't mine.

427
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,021
He pressed me too hard. I had no choice.

428
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,981
The woman at the convenience store

429
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,740
scrolled on her phone.

430
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:43,901
She saw the news

431
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:45,341
and recognized me.

432
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:47,381
And the auto repair shop owner

433
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:48,421
was calling the police.

434
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,901
So I hurt him.

435
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:50,780
What about Xu Gang?

436
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:53,381
Who's Xu Gang?

437
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,381
The motorcycle driver.

438
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,821
You stole his bike

439
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,180
and then killed him.

440
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,700
Remember now?

441
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:01,541
I didn't know him.

442
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,341
(I didn't mean to kill him.)

443
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,580
(But he fought me desperately)

444
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,541
(over a motorcycle.)

445
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,700
(I panicked a bit.)

446
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:11,901
(They were like)

447
00:36:11,981 --> 00:36:13,821
(a cornfield blocking my path.)

448
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,700
Whether I snapped them or chopped them,
I had to get through.

449
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:24,501
You killed He Hongqing's whole family.

450
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:27,061
Why did you spare the child?

451
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,580
I'm human,

452
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,620
not a monster.

453
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:38,021
Besides,

454
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,541
that kid hadn't done anything wrong.

455
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,780
After all this,

456
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:46,981
you think your parents' deaths

457
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:49,381
were entirely your uncle's fault.

458
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,901
You think killing him was justified.

459
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,260
If we hadn't caught you,

460
00:36:55,461 --> 00:36:56,421
were you going

461
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,180
to let your nephew settle that score

462
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,700
when he grew up?

463
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,300
To turn him into the next you?

464
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:09,740
As you said,

465
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,580
that kid did nothing wrong.

466
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,421
The adults messed up.

467
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:16,501
Why make a kid pay the price?

468
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,180
How are you any better than your uncle?

469
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,140
Right.

470
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:23,461
So I'm confessing everything now

471
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:26,941
and cooperating fully.

472
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,421
I'm cooperating.

473
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,260
I wasn't trying to run.

474
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,300
My parents lived in that village

475
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,821
most of their lives

476
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,821
but never saw the real sea.

477
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,341
I wanted to take them to see it.

478
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:42,220
The sea's better,

479
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,461
better than suffering
in the ancestral grave.

480
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:46,740
Right?

481
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,620
Well? Want some more?

482
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:56,580
No, I'm full.

483
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,941
That's enough.

484
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,180
We'll talk again next time, okay?

485
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:02,260
Got it all down?

486
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,021
Yes.

487
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:03,740
Officer.

488
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,941
Thank you.

489
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:07,821
I've kept these things bottled up

490
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,700
and never told anyone.

491
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,300
(Your grievances deserved to be heard,)

492
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:25,100
(but your crimes)

493
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:26,700
(must face judgment.)

494
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,381
Can I ask a favor?

495
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,541
I didn't make it to the sea.

496
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:43,821
My parents...

497
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,341
Tired?

498
00:39:21,421 --> 00:39:22,220
No.

499
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:24,381
Let me drive. You can take a break.

500
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:26,180
It's fine.

501
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:30,461
Why'd you say yes to He Changchun?

502
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,901
Didn't think much about it.

503
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,220
Just hoped it might

504
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:38,100
plant some kindness in him.

505
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:45,821
Have you contacted
your parents recently?

506
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:51,821
Filial piety
is the foundation of all virtues.

507
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,341
Call them more often, just to check in.

508
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,461
Okay.

509
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:01,140
Master,

510
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,341
I have a classmate in the States.

511
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,580
I heard they've developed a new drug

512
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,780
for Alzheimer's.

513
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:09,541
If you ever need it,

514
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,901
I'll have it brought for you.

515
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,780
Quite expensive, right?

516
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:16,021
No. It's on me.

517
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,501
How dutiful.

518
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,901
In the end,
we're all just a handful of ashes.

519
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:48,140
Scattered by the wind.

520
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,780
Cast into the sea,

521
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,220
without a trace left behind.

522
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,700
Why be so stubborn while alive?

523
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,981
We all meet the same end.

524
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:02,021
Master.

525
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,300
Why make me your apprentice?

526
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,021
Then why did you become a cop?

527
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,660
I know you can't let it go.

528
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:18,021
And I'm not asking you to.

529
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,140
You're still young.

530
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,260
Life ahead is long.

531
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,421
Don't trap yourself.

532
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,421
Master.

533
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:37,700
Spend more time with Xiaoyu
when you can.

534
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,021
When he's around,

535
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,780
you're genuinely happy.

536
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,941
A father's faults

537
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:48,861
are as numerous as the stars.

538
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,021
But his virtues?

539
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,700
Like the sun.

540
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,620
When it rises,

541
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:57,180
the stars all vanish.
