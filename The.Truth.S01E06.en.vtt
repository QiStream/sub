=The Truth=

01:11.531 --> 01:14.072
=Episode 6=

01:15.563 --> 01:19.576
(Bowang)

01:23.660 --> 01:24.300
Excuse me.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.539
Where is the table reserved by Miss Han?

01:26.660 --> 01:27.339
Sir.

01:27.339 --> 01:28.060
Second floor.

01:28.060 --> 01:28.739
Thank you.

01:28.739 --> 01:29.500
No problem.

01:36.979 --> 01:37.739
Little Zhao.

01:43.339 --> 01:44.339
Where should I sit?

01:44.940 --> 01:45.979
- Next to her.
- Next to him.

01:48.379 --> 01:49.179
I'll sit there.

01:49.179 --> 01:50.780
Next to Little Zhao.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.379
Off duty now, let's have a drink.

01:57.060 --> 01:59.060
No alcohol. I might get called in.

02:00.099 --> 02:01.020
Alright.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.899
You guys are killjoys.

02:03.459 --> 02:04.660
Then I'll drink by myself.

02:04.660 --> 02:05.459
Yu.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.660
One pot of spirit and two colas.

02:07.660 --> 02:08.420
- Okay.
- Spirit?

02:08.420 --> 02:09.540
You're really something.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.260
I'll open it for you.

02:20.659 --> 02:21.459
I'm not drinking.

02:21.580 --> 02:22.380
I'll have water.

02:25.100 --> 02:25.659
I'll have it.

02:25.659 --> 02:26.980
I'll have it.

02:35.260 --> 02:36.659
Did you tell Little Qian

02:36.659 --> 02:37.659
that you're pursuing me?

02:38.619 --> 02:39.619
No.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.619
What for?

02:42.219 --> 02:43.820
You know I like Little Qian.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.179
I know you like Little Qian.

02:47.659 --> 02:49.459
But Little Qian doesn't like you.

02:49.659 --> 02:51.260
You're single, and I'm single.

02:51.459 --> 02:52.659
So I can pursue you.

02:52.659 --> 02:54.140
Don't need his permission, but yours.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.339
I haven't agreed.

02:55.339 --> 02:56.260
I know you haven't.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.380
That's why I'm pursuing you.

02:58.020 --> 02:58.659
Fine.

02:59.459 --> 03:00.659
You're paying today.

03:01.219 --> 03:01.899
No problem.

03:02.499 --> 03:03.860
This place isn't cheap.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.860
Officer, can your salary cover this?

03:06.860 --> 03:09.020
Don't worry. I've got Qian here.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.619
She owns this place.

03:11.980 --> 03:14.059
I opened this place for him.

03:33.020 --> 03:33.659
Try this.

03:34.899 --> 03:35.540
This.

03:35.659 --> 03:36.820
This is way too much.

03:37.820 --> 03:38.659
Not at all.

03:38.739 --> 03:40.939
You need nutrients. Eat more.

03:41.380 --> 03:42.659
All are your favorites.

03:43.939 --> 03:44.980
Just this once.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.260
Don't do this again.

03:46.380 --> 03:47.540
Too much to finish.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.059
You eat too.

03:50.739 --> 03:51.540
Got it.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.580
Next time, let's eat at my place.

03:54.739 --> 03:55.540
Your place?

03:57.059 --> 03:59.179
I opened a restaurant nearby.

03:59.179 --> 04:00.420
You know the ropes.

04:00.420 --> 04:01.980
Come try the food sometime.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.260
Why open a restaurant suddenly?

04:06.619 --> 04:09.059
You cops are busy,

04:09.059 --> 04:10.219
but you still need to eat.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.939
If you eat at my restaurant,

04:11.939 --> 04:12.939
I won't charge you.

04:18.060 --> 04:19.740
Actually, I wanted

04:20.020 --> 04:21.859
you to come eat often,

04:22.459 --> 04:24.979
then we'd see each other more.

04:28.260 --> 04:29.580
Han Zhao, I've told you.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.500
It won't work.

04:32.459 --> 04:33.580
Why not?

04:34.060 --> 04:35.580
We're both single and available.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.140
And I've got this.

04:40.620 --> 04:41.539
I support you

04:42.180 --> 04:43.180
to open a restaurant.

04:44.339 --> 04:45.659
But if you say it's for me,

04:46.899 --> 04:47.659
I won't accept it.

04:49.180 --> 04:49.979
Got it.

04:50.779 --> 04:52.459
Enough talk, just eat.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.180
Quit rambling.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.700
Eat this. Your favorite.

04:58.020 --> 04:58.820
You eat too.

05:02.979 --> 05:03.899
If you say so,

05:04.659 --> 05:05.859
I won't come again.

05:08.180 --> 05:08.979
Well...

05:09.580 --> 05:11.180
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.979
Why only love Little Qian?

05:14.580 --> 05:15.899
You're not his type.

05:16.659 --> 05:18.060
Do you know his type?

05:18.140 --> 05:18.979
Of course, I do.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.380
He likes long-haired,

05:20.380 --> 05:21.459
gentle,

05:21.459 --> 05:23.620
simple,

05:23.620 --> 05:24.859
and delicate girls.

05:25.979 --> 05:27.260
You're not that type.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.140
You told him about Chen Yumo?

05:40.380 --> 05:40.899
This way.

05:43.539 --> 05:45.820
Mr. Pang, you're here.
The room your booked is upstairs.

05:45.820 --> 05:46.419
This way.

05:46.419 --> 05:47.020
Thank you.

05:48.979 --> 05:49.779
Please, this way.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.459
What would you like to eat?

05:52.779 --> 05:53.779
Salt-baked mackerel pike.

05:53.940 --> 05:54.500
Thank you.

06:04.219 --> 06:05.219
Pretty woman?

06:06.859 --> 06:07.659
Do you know her?

06:08.060 --> 06:08.859
Colleagues.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.140
Same department with us.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.620
I really underestimated
you police officers.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.620
Your spending level is quite high.

06:17.820 --> 06:18.899
I think Ziwu

06:18.899 --> 06:20.219
is here for another blind date.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.260
Blind date?

06:23.539 --> 06:24.700
That guy comes here often.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.219
He brings a different woman each time.

06:33.299 --> 06:34.260
I often

06:35.260 --> 06:36.299
come to this place,

06:36.940 --> 06:38.339
so I booked here.

06:39.020 --> 06:39.979
The environment is nice.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.820
Take a look at the menu.

06:41.820 --> 06:43.099
If you don't like it here,

06:43.099 --> 06:45.539
we can change another place.

06:45.859 --> 06:46.620
No need.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.099
Anything will do.

06:48.940 --> 06:49.539
Alright.

06:49.899 --> 06:50.979
Let's eat first.

06:51.099 --> 06:51.859
By the way,

06:52.260 --> 06:54.140
I booked a KTV room.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.060
After dinner, we can go sing songs.

06:57.740 --> 06:58.580
Mr. Pang.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.740
I need to explain something to you.

07:02.419 --> 07:03.539
Actually, I'm not interested

07:03.539 --> 07:05.979
in this blind date today.

07:06.339 --> 07:07.099
The reason I came

07:07.099 --> 07:09.339
is that I didn't want
to embarrass Mr. Zhao.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.260
After today's meal,

07:11.260 --> 07:12.140
I think

07:12.140 --> 07:13.899
we won't meet again.

07:14.459 --> 07:16.539
So let's split

07:16.979 --> 07:18.099
the meal cost.

07:21.820 --> 07:22.620
It's okay.

07:23.419 --> 07:25.140
Take a look at the menu and order food.

07:26.140 --> 07:27.380
I need to use the restroom.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.580
Sir, what would you like to order?

07:34.859 --> 07:35.419
It's okay.

07:35.419 --> 07:36.380
I'll go to the restroom.

07:39.180 --> 07:40.060
I'll take a leak.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.260
I'll go too.

07:47.380 --> 07:47.940
Wait,

07:47.940 --> 07:49.459
you two don't go to the same restroom.

07:49.459 --> 07:50.072
Well...

07:50.899 --> 07:51.539
Hello.

07:53.219 --> 07:54.140
Having a blind date.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.539
(Restroom)
A police, over thirty.

07:58.859 --> 08:00.979
I don't know why my mom knew her.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.299
Hello.

08:03.060 --> 08:03.659
Hello.

08:05.539 --> 08:06.779
But honestly,

08:07.180 --> 08:07.940
I probably won't

08:07.940 --> 08:09.539
get much benefit from this woman.

08:10.299 --> 08:12.219
I did some digging before I came.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.500
With her level and position,

08:14.500 --> 08:15.219
she can earn

08:15.580 --> 08:17.260
ten thousand yuan at most per month.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.620
What's the use?

08:22.740 --> 08:23.940
To put it harshly,

08:24.419 --> 08:25.820
if she were frontline,

08:26.260 --> 08:27.099
died in service,

08:27.099 --> 08:29.140
I could get a compensation
of hundreds of thousands.

08:29.580 --> 08:30.099
Really.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.939
Just a woman without feminine charm,
no fun at all.

08:37.144 --> 08:38.936
(Restroom)

08:43.980 --> 08:44.779
Who did it?

08:46.220 --> 08:47.220
Who beat me?

08:47.819 --> 08:48.500
Where are you?

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
Don't dare to admit it?

08:51.500 --> 08:52.376
What happened?

08:52.376 --> 08:52.980
Where were you?

08:52.980 --> 08:53.819
Who's in charge?

08:53.899 --> 08:54.539
Took so long.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.779
No one leaves
until I get an explanation.

08:57.539 --> 08:58.500
Who's in charge?

08:59.620 --> 09:00.299
Call him over,

09:00.299 --> 09:01.659
or I'll call the police. Hurry up.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.620
Where's the person in charge?

09:06.140 --> 09:07.460
Call him over. Who hit me?

09:11.659 --> 09:13.340
Get me the surveillance footage now.

09:13.699 --> 09:14.380
Hurry up.

09:22.939 --> 09:24.179
Is this your car?

09:26.299 --> 09:27.179
My friend's.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.340
Sorry for causing trouble.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.100
Thank your friend for me.

09:33.539 --> 09:34.659
It's okay.

09:42.419 --> 09:44.620
I've seen the girl who had dinner

09:44.620 --> 09:46.380
with you today.

09:47.819 --> 09:48.620
Where?

09:49.779 --> 09:51.419
When you first came to the department.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.539
Right at the entrance.

09:54.419 --> 09:55.860
I remember it quite clearly.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.299
I remember she had

09:57.299 --> 09:59.740
a Japanese lunchbox wrapped in cloth

09:59.740 --> 10:00.860
in her hand.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.899
We grew up together.

10:06.179 --> 10:08.299
I can tell that girl really likes you.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.059
Ziwu.

10:10.699 --> 10:12.179
We're just friends.

10:27.579 --> 10:29.419
I wish she thought the same way.

10:34.179 --> 10:35.460
I forgot to warn that scum

10:35.460 --> 10:36.760
to stay away from my restaurant.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.140
After what you did,

10:39.140 --> 10:40.460
he'd never dare come.

10:41.179 --> 10:42.380
I bet he won't even come near

10:42.380 --> 10:43.220
the area.

10:43.299 --> 10:44.260
But anyway,

10:44.260 --> 10:45.699
you shouldn't have beaten him.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.899
Didn't you hear what Little Qian said?

10:49.340 --> 10:51.299
He's trying to exploit women.

10:51.299 --> 10:52.220
Not a chance.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.740
And I turned off the cameras

10:54.740 --> 10:55.460
near the restroom.

10:55.939 --> 10:57.100
Smart move!

10:57.179 --> 10:58.779
He has no idea who beat him.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.620
You didn't see the face of Little Qian.

11:01.939 --> 11:03.100
If I hadn't hit him first,

11:03.100 --> 11:04.340
he would've done it instead.

11:04.939 --> 11:05.740
Right.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.220
Has he been like this?

11:08.220 --> 11:10.059
So violent?

11:10.220 --> 11:11.500
Of course not!

11:13.260 --> 11:15.699
Little Qian has always been

11:16.340 --> 11:17.340
good at learning

11:18.260 --> 11:19.260
and gentle.

11:20.140 --> 11:21.899
He can cook

11:23.179 --> 11:24.260
and paint well.

11:24.539 --> 11:25.819
He was a track and field star.

11:27.340 --> 11:28.579
Total heartthrob!

11:29.939 --> 11:30.740
Really?

11:32.539 --> 11:33.819
Cross my heart.

11:34.939 --> 11:35.899
Let me tell you.

11:35.899 --> 11:38.340
Many people
had crushes on him back then.

11:38.340 --> 11:40.419
(There was a long line of admirers!)

11:40.980 --> 11:41.819
Little Qian.

11:41.819 --> 11:43.699
(If we were taking numbers,)

11:44.100 --> 11:45.059
(I'd be first in line.)

11:45.059 --> 11:46.899
Little Qian, fight for it!

11:54.260 --> 11:56.380
(But he only had eyes for Chen Yumo.)

11:57.980 --> 11:59.419
Because of Chen Yumo,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.460
he fell out with his parents

12:02.740 --> 12:04.299
and went to police academy,

12:04.579 --> 12:05.860
becoming a police.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.980
The most dangerous kind,
criminal police.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.179
After all these years,

12:10.539 --> 12:13.020
he'd chase any lead

12:14.299 --> 12:15.779
about Chen Yumo

12:16.020 --> 12:17.659
until he confirmed it was false.

12:18.100 --> 12:18.899
It's been ten years.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.939
You know he doesn't like you.

12:22.579 --> 12:24.179
Doesn't that hurt you?

12:28.579 --> 12:30.620
It hurts, of course.

12:33.140 --> 12:34.220
But I'm willing to wait.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.500
I'm still young, right?

12:37.899 --> 12:39.100
For someone I love,

12:40.740 --> 12:41.899
I'll take the chance.

12:47.980 --> 12:49.059
I'll grab more drinks.

12:57.304 --> 12:58.360
One.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.260
Already back?

13:02.980 --> 13:03.860
What are you doing?

13:14.380 --> 13:16.659
Little Zhao

13:19.260 --> 13:21.460
rides motorcycles and runs a restaurant.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.419
Where else could I find
such an amazing girl?

13:26.140 --> 13:26.899
I've decided.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.220
I need to earn more money.

13:29.899 --> 13:31.620
One meal cost me half a month's salary.

13:31.620 --> 13:32.299
That won't do.

13:32.299 --> 13:33.220
Can't keep this up.

13:34.419 --> 13:35.579
Where are you going?

13:37.260 --> 13:39.380
Are you sneaking off to see Little Zhao?

13:41.299 --> 13:42.779
Go on!

13:45.539 --> 13:47.299
I'll focus on earning money.

13:47.779 --> 13:49.340
Work hard. Earn big.

14:01.547 --> 14:03.896
(At the department or at home?)

14:04.012 --> 14:09.944
(Zhang Ziwu:
At the department or at home?)

15:17.539 --> 15:19.260
Ziwu.

15:20.340 --> 15:20.980
Lei.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.699
Little Qian's parents
are overseas, right?

15:26.659 --> 15:28.140
I've never heard him call them

15:28.140 --> 15:29.419
once in the dorm.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.620
What a distant family.

15:31.620 --> 15:33.740
But he and Captain Leng...

15:34.740 --> 15:36.620
Honestly, they're kind of similar.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.220
Men of few words, workaholics,

15:39.460 --> 15:40.340
avoid relationships.

15:41.179 --> 15:41.939
Talking to them

15:41.939 --> 15:43.419
is like pulling teeth sometimes.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.620
Can't figure out
what Little Zhao sees in him.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.020
He's handsome!

15:51.500 --> 15:52.380
Little Zhao?

15:54.980 --> 15:56.340
The girl from that restaurant?

15:58.059 --> 15:59.059
How do you know?

16:01.059 --> 16:03.020
She's really into Ye Qian.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.179
Don't get your hopes up.

16:04.980 --> 16:06.620
Something's going on.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.020
Hurry. Tell me!

16:08.220 --> 16:10.100
What is there to tell?

16:10.460 --> 16:11.500
Not promising?

16:11.980 --> 16:12.899
Unrequited love.

16:14.179 --> 16:15.020
How tough.

16:19.595 --> 16:22.443
(Shancheng Community, North Gate)

16:32.619 --> 16:40.152
(Eternal Love)

16:58.091 --> 17:04.024
(China Railway High-speed)

18:09.900 --> 18:11.020
I've booked the room.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.339
I'll pick him up tomorrow noon.

18:12.420 --> 18:15.220
Okay. I'll transfer you the room fee
via WeChat this afternoon.

18:15.619 --> 18:16.420
No need.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.539
He hasn't finished his homework.

18:18.539 --> 18:20.180
It's in the bag.
Tell him to do it, okay?

18:20.420 --> 18:21.940
Xiaoyu, be good, okay?

18:21.940 --> 18:23.260
I will pick you up tomorrow noon.

18:23.260 --> 18:23.819
Alright.

18:24.099 --> 18:24.819
I'm leaving.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.460
Where do you want to go?

18:30.020 --> 18:31.059
Let's go eat.

18:31.420 --> 18:32.440
What do you want to eat?

18:33.339 --> 18:34.260
Anything.

18:56.539 --> 18:57.260
Where's Master?

18:57.900 --> 18:58.660
He took leave.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.180
He took leave?

19:01.220 --> 19:02.059
Where did he go?

19:03.180 --> 19:03.980
He went to Shanghai.

19:08.099 --> 19:09.940
Well, could you give this to him for me?

19:18.900 --> 19:19.619
Thanks.

19:32.664 --> 19:35.480
(Theater Entrance)

19:39.180 --> 19:39.980
Are you a child?

19:40.220 --> 19:40.980
No.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.740
Is this fun?

19:41.900 --> 19:42.859
Yes.

19:43.339 --> 19:44.299
Why are you alone?

19:44.700 --> 19:45.619
Where's Little Qian?

19:45.619 --> 19:47.220
Something holds him up,
so he won't come.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.220
Why didn't you tell me?

19:49.220 --> 19:50.980
If I'd tell you, you wouldn't have come.

19:51.099 --> 19:51.619
Take it.

19:51.819 --> 19:52.500
What for?

19:52.619 --> 19:53.379
I'm leaving.

19:54.619 --> 19:55.660
Wait. You're already here.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.660
We can just watch it together.

19:57.900 --> 20:00.099
About that motorcycle case,
I've wanted to thank you.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.099
You thank me?

20:01.579 --> 20:03.500
Little Qian should be
the one thanking me.

20:03.539 --> 20:05.819
With our relationship,
it doesn't really matter.

20:05.819 --> 20:07.700
It took you a whole month
to recall that?

20:08.500 --> 20:09.579
I've been remembering it.

20:09.579 --> 20:11.020
But my actions got hindered.

20:11.020 --> 20:11.700
Look at my hand.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.579
I'm like a fortune cat.

20:13.579 --> 20:14.740
I can barely manage to eat.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.900
You can barely manage to eat.

20:17.059 --> 20:18.700
But you send me selfies every day.

20:18.819 --> 20:20.180
You fortune cat!

20:25.819 --> 20:27.379
You thank me by inviting me to a movie,

20:27.379 --> 20:28.900
and I bought the tickets?

20:29.220 --> 20:31.099
After the movie,
I'll treat you to dinner.

20:31.099 --> 20:31.980
Not a big deal.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.619
Relax. I'm shopping with my mom.

20:43.619 --> 20:44.579
I'll tell her now.

20:45.779 --> 20:47.700
Since when did I become your mom?

20:47.819 --> 20:49.500
Last time, you sent
Little Qian dumplings.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.059
I lied to him

20:50.059 --> 20:51.500
that my mom made them.

20:52.940 --> 20:54.779
And you told me he accepted them

20:54.779 --> 20:55.859
and really enjoyed them?

20:56.180 --> 20:57.619
He did accept them and eat them.

20:57.619 --> 20:58.819
And he enjoyed them.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.299
Si Yuanlong.

21:01.299 --> 21:02.660
Can you stop telling lies?

21:02.660 --> 21:04.180
Can I trust you to handle things?

21:04.339 --> 21:05.819
Yes! Of course.

21:05.819 --> 21:06.539
Absolutely.

21:08.339 --> 21:10.500
Are you wearing Little Qian's jacket?

21:11.859 --> 21:12.779
He gave them to me.

21:12.940 --> 21:13.500
How is it?

21:14.020 --> 21:15.660
Do I look better than him wearing it?

21:16.568 --> 21:17.299
W-Well...

21:17.299 --> 21:18.260
Talk about that later.

21:18.260 --> 21:18.980
Let's go watch it.

22:01.644 --> 22:06.680
(Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

22:07.224 --> 22:07.896

22:29.356 --> 22:31.896
(Leng Qiming: Just had a meal with him.
He's doing homework now.)

22:32.396 --> 22:34.648
(Zhang Ziwu: Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

22:34.648 --> 22:42.840
(Leng Qiming: Just had a meal with him.
He's doing homework now.)

22:42.924 --> 22:48.472
(Zhang Ziwu: Talk to him more.
Don't just stare at him.)

22:55.779 --> 22:57.020
Got a lot of homework?

22:57.500 --> 22:58.500
It's manageable.

23:00.020 --> 23:02.379
I've been swamped lately.

23:02.936 --> 23:03.619
Well...

23:03.779 --> 23:04.339
I know.

23:04.940 --> 23:07.220
Call me if anything's wrong.

23:07.660 --> 23:08.299
Nothing's wrong.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.859
How are you and your mom

23:11.940 --> 23:14.180
getting used to things over there?

23:15.420 --> 23:16.619
Dad, I'm doing homework.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.500
Want ice cream?

23:27.940 --> 23:28.940
Chocolate.

23:30.619 --> 23:31.139
Okay.

23:34.619 --> 23:35.220
I'll buy it.

23:51.980 --> 23:52.579
Ye.

23:53.139 --> 23:53.980
- Chief Xu.
- Where's your master?

23:54.660 --> 23:55.420
Went to Shanghai.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.339
Shanghai?

23:58.139 --> 23:58.980
To see his son?

23:59.819 --> 24:00.740
Call him.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.579
Ask him to come back.

24:02.379 --> 24:02.940
Okay.

24:11.260 --> 24:13.339
Don't eat this often.

24:14.379 --> 24:15.059
Too fatty.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.619
I've paid for the room.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.420
I'll send you the money.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.260
- Don't bother.
- Let's go.

24:27.940 --> 24:28.700
Be a good boy.

24:29.139 --> 24:29.819
Let's go.

24:30.579 --> 24:31.379
Bye, Dad.

24:32.779 --> 24:33.700
How have you been?

24:34.220 --> 24:35.740
Had a nice time?

24:36.020 --> 24:37.740
Have you missed me?

24:38.139 --> 24:39.220
Did you bring me a gift?

24:39.220 --> 24:40.579
Of course.

How could I forget that?

24:56.420 --> 24:57.859
You guys are doing a charity event?

24:58.220 --> 24:58.740
Have water.

24:58.740 --> 24:59.260
Thank you.

24:59.420 --> 25:00.059
How strong

25:00.059 --> 25:00.740
the sunshine is.

25:00.859 --> 25:01.539
Thanks.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.220
Let's see. What kind of dogs are these?

25:04.500 --> 25:05.339
So cute.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.099
Have some water.

25:06.099 --> 25:07.180
- Hello, this is Jiao Lei.
- Here you go.

25:07.980 --> 25:08.980
What kind of dogs?

25:09.020 --> 25:09.859
Okay, I'll be there.

25:09.859 --> 25:10.819
Are they strays?

(Ye Qian:
Urgent mission. Come back now.)

25:30.859 --> 25:31.660
Little Zhao.

25:33.180 --> 25:33.980
I've got a mission.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.099
I have to go.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.859
What do you mean?

25:36.859 --> 25:38.059
You insisted on watching.

25:38.059 --> 25:39.859
Now you want to leave me here
all by myself?

25:40.220 --> 25:41.099
I'm really sorry.

25:41.099 --> 25:42.420
That's just how my job is.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.539
Please forgive me.

25:44.539 --> 25:45.500
I owe you a meal.

Aren't you off today?

25:47.779 --> 25:48.579
You're not leaving.

25:51.099 --> 25:51.779
I'm going.

25:58.579 --> 25:59.339
Everyone's here?

26:05.740 --> 26:06.779
Three days ago,

26:07.139 --> 26:09.220
within Beicheng County's jurisdiction,

26:09.220 --> 26:10.460
a homicide occurred.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.339
The victim, Wang Xiaole,
lived in Apartment 402,

26:13.339 --> 26:15.299
Building 10 of Shancheng Community,

26:15.660 --> 26:17.660
got murdered in her home.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.420
Beicheng CID requested assistance
from city police department.

26:21.579 --> 26:24.339
And after deliberation
by city police department leadership,

26:24.339 --> 26:27.700
our department and the forensic unit

26:27.700 --> 26:28.859
are assigned to assist.

26:28.859 --> 26:31.539
These two are from Beicheng CID.

26:31.779 --> 26:33.379
Let them brief us on the case.

26:33.980 --> 26:35.139
Just call me Sun.

Good. I'll brief everyone.

26:43.619 --> 26:44.740

26:44.740 --> 26:47.579
a teacher at the Yunxi Health School.

26:48.260 --> 26:50.139
Her parents reported the case.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.420
According to her dad,

26:52.539 --> 26:55.660
around 9 PM on the night of the murder,

26:55.779 --> 26:57.660
he sent her a message.

26:57.980 --> 27:00.099
But he waited until the next morning

27:00.099 --> 27:01.139
and still got no reply.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.660
So he and his wife got anxious

27:02.660 --> 27:04.700
and went straight to her home.

(Wang Xiaole's bedroom)

27:26.660 --> 27:28.420
Long, that outfit
looks pretty sharp today.

27:30.539 --> 27:31.379
Double-check it.

27:32.139 --> 27:32.700
Okay.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.688
Are you crazy?
Why are you wearing my jacket?

27:39.379 --> 27:41.059
You gave it to me.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.539
Why can't I wear my own jacket?

27:43.579 --> 27:44.664
When did I give it to you?

27:45.339 --> 27:46.420
That day we had hotpot.

27:58.539 --> 28:00.260
You threw such a nice jacket away?

28:02.339 --> 28:03.379
Quit the nonsense.

28:04.299 --> 28:05.379
I threw this jacket away,

28:05.579 --> 28:06.579
not gave it to you.

28:06.579 --> 28:07.619
(Police)
You did throw it away.

28:07.619 --> 28:08.420
But I asked you

28:08.420 --> 28:10.339
to give it to me if you didn't want it.

28:10.339 --> 28:11.500
I asked you several times.

28:12.779 --> 28:14.339
I thought you were joking.

28:14.779 --> 28:15.819
Joking?

28:16.099 --> 28:18.059
Why would I joke about a nice jacket?

28:19.579 --> 28:21.020
It just had some frays.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.339
I fixed them and it's all good.
Throwing it away is such a waste. Look.

28:26.379 --> 28:26.980
Alright.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.020
Then don't wear it when I do.

28:30.619 --> 28:32.740
Fine. Tell me in advance,
I'll wear a different one.

28:32.819 --> 28:34.360
I don't want to wear the same as you.

28:45.180 --> 28:45.740
Captain Leng.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.339
The primary crime scene

28:47.339 --> 28:49.220
has been fully processed by our team.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.220
Tell me about this community.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.579
Shancheng Community

28:55.579 --> 28:57.460
was built over twenty years ago.

28:57.660 --> 28:58.539
The buildings are old.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.299
Look, over there.

29:00.420 --> 29:01.619
It borders a wooded area.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.619
It's pitch black at night.

29:04.339 --> 29:05.980
We immediately

29:05.980 --> 29:06.900
reviewed all accessible

29:06.900 --> 29:08.900
(Keeping pet in a civilized way)
CCTV footage from the community.

29:09.004 --> 29:09.619
(Keeping pet in a legal way)

29:09.619 --> 29:10.660
At the south gate,

29:10.940 --> 29:12.260
a suspicious person was spotted.

29:13.379 --> 29:14.900
However, his identity

29:14.940 --> 29:16.579
remains unknown.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.740
Fingerprints and footprints
from the hallway surroundings

29:39.740 --> 29:40.700
and living room

29:40.700 --> 29:42.420
have been re-collected.

29:42.420 --> 29:44.740
The entryway mat was taken
by Beicheng CID.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.299
A total of five bloody footprints
were found

29:47.379 --> 29:49.779
on the entryway mat
and in the living room.

29:50.059 --> 29:52.660
Details await further testing.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.099
Zhou.

30:44.099 --> 30:45.579
Based on bloodstain distribution,

30:45.579 --> 30:47.980
it's concentrated near the nightstand.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.660
The blood spatter
shows a high-velocity pattern.

30:55.539 --> 30:57.059
This indicates a powerful impact.

30:57.059 --> 30:59.192
I assumed the suspect
is a young or middle-aged male.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.940
Based on the stroke width,

31:16.940 --> 31:19.579
it was likely written
using a blood-soaked finger.

31:19.859 --> 31:21.180
But no fingerprints were left.

31:24.940 --> 31:25.619
Captain Leng.

31:27.180 --> 31:28.020
Take a look.

31:41.779 --> 31:42.539
Thoughts?

31:44.660 --> 31:45.900
The writing flows smoothly.

31:46.220 --> 31:47.220
The strokes are steady.

31:47.819 --> 31:49.260
And it's in standard script.

31:50.779 --> 31:52.619
What kind of person

31:52.779 --> 31:54.500
writes like this?

31:56.099 --> 31:56.819
Composed

31:58.740 --> 31:59.379
and calm.

32:02.539 --> 32:04.139
Probably well-educated.

32:05.379 --> 32:07.539
After committing such extreme violence,

32:08.139 --> 32:10.980
he still had composure
to write on the wall.

32:13.020 --> 32:14.660
I think he is someone meticulous

32:15.339 --> 32:16.379
and unflappable.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.460
It was likely premeditated.

33:34.828 --> 33:37.304
(Wench)

33:49.803 --> 33:53.560
(Asepsis Testing Room)

34:11.736 --> 34:13.496
(South Gate-03)

34:26.123 --> 34:29.752
(Wench)

34:46.764 --> 34:49.816
(South Gate-03)

35:05.100 --> 35:07.128
(Wench)

35:12.012 --> 35:17.496
(Wench)

35:22.059 --> 35:23.300
(Forensic Unit)

35:23.300 --> 35:25.099
Based on blood coagulation at the scene

35:25.099 --> 35:26.900
and livor mortis,

35:26.900 --> 35:28.380
(Blood details at the crime scene)
the exact time of death was...

35:28.380 --> 35:29.500
The time of death

35:29.500 --> 35:32.420
was between 12 AM

35:32.420 --> 35:34.059
(Blood details at the crime scene)
and 1 AM the next day.

35:35.619 --> 35:37.900
Resulted from acute cerebral hemorrhage.

35:38.579 --> 35:40.259
The victim's skull

35:40.259 --> 35:42.099
(Blood details at the crime scene)
shows a depressed fracture,

35:43.300 --> 35:46.380
matching the corner of the nightstand.

35:46.700 --> 35:47.288
(Blood details at the crime scene)

35:47.288 --> 35:48.619
We can infer

35:48.619 --> 35:49.739
the suspect

35:49.940 --> 35:52.539
grabbed the victim's head

35:52.780 --> 35:54.179
and slammed it against the corner.

35:55.860 --> 35:57.860
Repeated, forceful impacts

35:57.860 --> 35:59.619
ruptured the left pericallosal artery

35:59.780 --> 36:01.659
and the left central artery,

36:01.820 --> 36:04.120
causing massive intracranial bleeding
and victim's death.

36:04.219 --> 36:06.420
Other wounds on the victim's body

36:06.420 --> 36:08.820
were inflicted shortly after death.

36:10.028 --> 36:11.460
(Victim's wound details)

36:11.460 --> 36:13.739
There are seventeen wounds total

36:13.739 --> 36:15.139
on the victim's torso and limbs.

36:15.659 --> 36:16.380
Look.

36:16.380 --> 36:19.619
These seventeen wounds
are straight, sharp,

36:19.820 --> 36:21.820
(Victim's wound details)
and uniform in length.

36:22.579 --> 36:24.579
This requires the suspect

36:24.579 --> 36:26.579
to possess precise control.

36:27.099 --> 36:28.099
Moreover, I noticed

36:28.579 --> 36:30.659
during the cutting,

36:30.659 --> 36:32.300
a downward pressure was applied.

36:32.619 --> 36:35.020
This motion matches
a scalpel user's technique.

36:36.099 --> 36:37.739
No fingerprints were found on scene.

36:38.139 --> 36:40.536
The killer wore gloves

36:40.536 --> 36:42.380
both during the murder
and writing on the wall.

36:42.668 --> 36:43.500
(Blood writing on the crime scene wall)

36:43.500 --> 36:45.579
I compared common types

36:45.579 --> 36:48.020
like cotton, synthetic fiber,
cloth, leather,

36:48.020 --> 36:49.179
and latex gloves.

36:49.539 --> 36:52.420
Only non-absorbent types
can be dipped in blood for writing.

36:52.619 --> 36:53.380
After elimination,

36:53.380 --> 36:55.860
only leather and latex
remain possibilities.

36:56.259 --> 36:58.020
Leather gloves

36:58.020 --> 37:00.619
are typically bulkier than fingers.

37:01.139 --> 37:02.460
When I tried writing in them,

37:02.460 --> 37:03.900
caused by the finger squeezing,

37:03.900 --> 37:05.980
the writing shows breaks or distortions.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.659
Difficult to write words with
uniform strokes on the wall,

37:08.659 --> 37:11.096
let alone the fluidity of the writing
on the crime scene wall.

37:11.420 --> 37:12.280
Leather gloves out.

37:12.619 --> 37:13.780
As for the last possibility,

37:13.780 --> 37:16.059
latex gloves are characterized
by high elasticity,

37:16.059 --> 37:17.219
smooth surface,

37:18.020 --> 37:20.699
and fit closest
to the size of human fingers.

37:21.820 --> 37:24.300
I bought commonly available
latex gloves on the market.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.020
(Blood writing on the crime scene wall)
After testing with blood,

37:27.020 --> 37:28.380
I preliminarily assumed the killer

37:28.380 --> 37:29.940
wore medical latex gloves.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.059
These gloves have talcum powder on them,

37:32.619 --> 37:34.020
which has

37:34.020 --> 37:36.460
a certain adhesive effect on the blood.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.259
This can result in dripping blood trails

37:38.259 --> 37:39.860
(Wretch)
forming below the writing.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.380
(Suspect's shoe printings
left on the crime scene floor)

37:41.380 --> 37:42.300
Around the hallway,

37:42.300 --> 37:44.699
on the entryway mat
and inside the crime scene,

37:44.940 --> 37:47.420
a total of five footprints
were collected.

37:47.820 --> 37:49.500
All are of size 43,

37:49.500 --> 37:51.099
mold-soled sneakers.

37:51.460 --> 37:53.500
The tread pattern shows minimal wear,

37:53.500 --> 37:55.500
indicating the shoes
might be relatively new.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.619
However, because this type of product

37:57.619 --> 37:59.739
is extremely common on the market,

37:59.900 --> 38:01.139
it has little reference value.

38:01.739 --> 38:04.059
Due to the small number
of footprints collected

38:04.059 --> 38:05.099
and their discontinuity,

38:05.380 --> 38:07.780
we can currently only roughly
infer that the suspect is

38:07.780 --> 38:09.579
(Suspect's shoe printings)
a male of medium build.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.739
We cannot infer

38:11.739 --> 38:13.659
more specific physical characteristics.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.099
The Shancheng Community

38:17.099 --> 38:19.020
has cameras only at the main gates

38:19.020 --> 38:21.139
on the north and south sides
for vehicle access.

38:21.659 --> 38:23.500
Those at the side gates
on the east and west,

38:23.500 --> 38:26.139
and between buildings,
are just for show,

38:26.139 --> 38:26.900
not even powered.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.179
Colleagues from Beicheng

38:30.619 --> 38:34.020
had conducted
a preliminary review of the footage.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.739
(Suspicious individual entering/exiting)
The time of this individual

38:37.259 --> 38:39.500
entering and exiting
through the south gate

38:39.500 --> 38:40.940
matches the time of the crime.

38:42.099 --> 38:43.059
Thus, Beicheng CID

38:43.059 --> 38:44.980
identified this person
as the prime suspect.

38:45.035 --> 38:45.720
(Victim's ex-husband entering/exiting)

38:45.816 --> 38:46.460
Okay.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.099
From this image, we can see

38:48.099 --> 38:50.380
he's wearing exactly a pair of

38:50.380 --> 38:52.300
mold-soled sneakers.

38:52.300 --> 38:53.300
(Victim's ex-husband entering/exiting)

38:53.300 --> 38:55.699
This person is the victim's
ex-husband, Wu Da.

38:56.020 --> 38:57.500
Captain Sun's team has confirmed

38:57.980 --> 39:00.099
that Wang Xiaole's boyfriend,
Huang Chong,

39:00.099 --> 39:01.940
was working overtime at the company
that night.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.940
His colleagues can attest to this.

39:04.699 --> 39:06.460
Wang Xiaole's parents also stated

39:06.699 --> 39:08.420
that the two had a good relationship.

39:08.420 --> 39:10.420
Moreover, both are
in their second marriage,

39:10.420 --> 39:11.739
with no financial conflicts.

39:12.259 --> 39:15.820
However,
Wang Xiaole's ex-husband, Wu Da,

39:16.340 --> 39:18.420
was seen entering and exiting
the Shancheng Community

39:18.420 --> 39:20.216
at 9 PM and 10 PM
on the night of the crime.

39:20.380 --> 39:22.579
Wu Da's semen was indeed
found inside the victim.

39:23.020 --> 39:25.579
But there's no evidence
of forced sexual activity at the scene.

39:26.259 --> 39:27.619
All evidence suggests

39:27.619 --> 39:29.659
the sexual encounter was consensual.

39:30.420 --> 39:31.739
They were divorced,

39:31.739 --> 39:33.259
yet they maintained that relationship.

39:33.259 --> 39:34.739
We need to look into it.

40:09.340 --> 40:09.940
Wu Da,

40:11.340 --> 40:12.460
we're here today

40:13.259 --> 40:14.259
to learn more

40:14.259 --> 40:15.420
about Wang Xiaole.

40:21.900 --> 40:23.259
Where did you injure your hand?

40:25.179 --> 40:26.099
I forgot.

40:26.940 --> 40:28.780
Probably bumped into something.

(Vascular Surgery, Dermatologic Surgery)

40:39.000 --> 40:39.896
(Clinical Oncology)

40:40.619 --> 40:42.179
How did he get so drunk?

40:42.460 --> 40:45.659
He was also like this
during your previous questioning?

40:47.579 --> 40:48.259
Yes.

40:49.300 --> 40:50.059
He was like this.

40:50.420 --> 40:52.659
(Surgery, Surgical Nursing)
It's said that ever since the divorce,

40:52.659 --> 40:53.900
(Vascular Surgery)
he's been drowning his sorrows in drink.

40:53.900 --> 40:56.219
(Clinical Oncology)
He seems unable to accept this reality.

40:56.340 --> 40:57.500
Do you know Wang Xiaole?

41:01.099 --> 41:01.860
My wife...

41:03.020 --> 41:03.860
Ex-wife.

41:04.340 --> 41:08.059
What were you doing
from 12 AM on the 9th

41:08.619 --> 41:09.579
to 1 AM on the 10th?

41:10.619 --> 41:11.259
Drinking.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.460
Where were you drinking?

41:13.780 --> 41:14.739
Specific location.

41:18.579 --> 41:21.460
The flower bed at the north gate
of Shancheng Community.

41:21.900 --> 41:22.980
Can anyone verify that?

41:24.860 --> 41:25.539
Verify?

41:26.460 --> 41:27.300
Verify what?

41:28.340 --> 41:29.860
What exactly happened, Officer?

41:31.579 --> 41:33.940
You went to Wang Xiaole's place
last night, didn't you?

41:35.500 --> 41:36.420
Why did you go there?

41:39.500 --> 41:40.699
I just... We...

41:42.380 --> 41:43.219
I went to get...

41:44.619 --> 41:46.539
Wait, officer.
I'm feeling really unwell.

41:46.980 --> 41:48.539
Can you just tell me what's wrong?

41:55.980 --> 41:56.619
Here.

42:07.739 --> 42:08.380
