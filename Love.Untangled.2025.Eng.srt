1
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:23,066
I was five when I first confessed my love.

2
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,319
It was a success,
but it happened on a grave.

3
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,738
And the boy was my cousin.

4
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,448
KANG-JIN, I LIKE YOU

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,742
The second time was in third grade.

6
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,246
I wrote "I like you" on a note,

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,416
and he wrote back, "I like you too."

8
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,419
Then he moved schools the very next day.

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,131
Seriously, why say yes in the first place?

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,384
Then it happened.

11
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:51,636
Three, two, one.

12
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,722
My curly hair genes started kicking in.

13
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,684
Three, two, one.

14
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,772
Unlike my fraternal twin Hye-ri,

15
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,690
my hair turned into a tangled mess,

16
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,777
and so did my life.

17
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:20,373
The day I was gonna ask out
the boy next door,

18
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:26,212
he left with Hye-ri instead,
her hair all sleek and perfect.

19
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,675
That's when I decided.

20
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,012
I'll never confess my love ever again.

21
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,395
Never.

22
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,151
I said never.

23
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,655
LOVE UNTANGLED

24
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,074
SIMPLE DIY HAIRSTYLES

25
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:09,589
Hey.

26
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:11,507
What are you doing?

27
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:15,261
Hey! It's my turn this week.

28
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,346
I gotta listen to Good Morning Pops.

29
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,603
Mom, she's breaking our deal.

30
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:26,355
Why all the fuss
this early in the morning?

31
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,233
She always does whatever she wants.

32
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:32,528
But she says she needs it to study.

33
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:35,781
And, Se-ri,
you only ever listen to Korean pop.

34
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,659
Then I want a CD player.

35
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,662
Sure, just trade your mom for one.

36
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,580
Here.

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,332
Honey.

38
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,750
What are you watching?

39
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,168
PAK SE-RI, GOLF QUEEN

40
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,795
-Come eat.
-Look, Se-ri. Check that out.

41
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,214
Nothing is impossible.

42
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,716
She's the best in the world.

43
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,427
-Some things are impossible.
-That's not true.

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,929
I said come eat.

45
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,013
Your name's Se-ri too.

46
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,141
Here, this hair right here.

47
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:06,479
This curly hair you gave me
is impossible to straighten.

48
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,356
Oh, come on.

49
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,775
That's money saved on perms.

50
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,236
Dad! It actually costs way more.

51
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,363
Do you know
how expensive straightening is?

52
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,739
Will you pay for it?

53
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,116
No breakfast if you don't come now!
Come eat!

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,701
All right.

55
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,162
-Hey, Oh-my-Seri!
-Hurry up!

56
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,122
Come on out!

57
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,338
Hye-ri was being a pain again
this morning.

58
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,798
Yeah?

59
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,174
What now?

60
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,222
-I won.
-Give it.

61
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,139
Here.

62
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,184
Hey, is it true
she came top in her school again?

63
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:47,061
Whatever, I don't care.

64
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,229
What's this?

65
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:51,524
Hey, you two are nothing alike.
Are you really sisters?

66
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,277
Da-ul, don't push it.

67
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,364
Yeah, and Oh-my-Seri here
is far cuter than Hye-ri.

68
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,033
-Sol-ji.
-Hmm?

69
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:03,577
Do you owe Se-ri or something?

70
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,455
Se-ri, just this once,
can we switch deskmates?

71
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,207
Why? You have Sung-rae again?

72
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,543
I can tolerate him,
but not as my deskmate.

73
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,961
My ears can't take it.

74
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,296
Hey!

75
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,464
Oh-my-Seri and Solbangul!

76
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:16,924
What a lovely day!

77
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,301
It's him.

78
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,927
Hurry, let's go.

79
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,643
Hey!

80
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,314
GARAM HIGH SCHOOL

81
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,658
Here.

82
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:44,493
-It looks so heavy.
-Just take it.

83
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,208
It's Kim Hyun.

84
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,085
Isn't that Hyun?

85
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,086
Look at him!

86
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,965
It's Kim Hyun!

87
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,264
Kim Hyun.

88
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,226
The boy that half of my school
has a crush on.

89
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,857
Did he just wave at me?

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,900
Do you know her?

91
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,033
What was that?

92
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,409
Why did he wave at you?

93
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,703
Well,

94
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:29,497
at the beach yesterday--

95
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,290
-Yes, what?
-Go on.

96
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:40,341
It was nice out, so I went for a swim.

97
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,315
KIM HYUN

98
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,376
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,963
Same school, huh?

100
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,426
I thought only I knew this spot.

101
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,389
That's what I thought too.

102
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,434
Wait, he left his clothes
right next to yours?

103
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:32,768
Yeah.

104
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,355
Why? Why did he do that?
Maybe it means something.

105
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,982
Seems flirty.

106
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,903
Guys, excuse us.
Not interested in any of that.

107
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,197
Make way. Let us through.

108
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,115
Move it.

109
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,033
1ST SEMESTER 2ND MOCK EXAM
SENIOR CLASS RANKINGS

110
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,537
Why are you even looking?
You're not on it.

111
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,374
-Hyun.
-It's really him.

112
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,292
100TH, KIM HYUN

113
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,961
Se-ri, he's moving
to the self-study room, then.

114
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:03,007
The self-study room is
only for the top 100 students.

115
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,133
Legend has it,

116
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,094
if you ask someone out there,
it always works.

117
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:10,848
No more ocean swims for me.
I always get hungry in there.

118
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,185
I'm too sticky to go for tteokbokki,
but too lazy to go home and shower.

119
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,270
But I always end up craving tteokbokki.

120
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,898
And it tastes better when you eat out.

121
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,567
Hey, have you been to Cheongsu Snacks?

122
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,651
Sung-rae.

123
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,112
You have?

124
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:28,616
Now I get why they say
their ears hurt around you.

125
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,575
Who said that?

126
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,202
Was it Sol-ji?

127
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,329
Hey, Ma Sol-ji!

128
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,956
Ever been to Cheongsu Snacks?

129
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:39,001
Stop talking, will you? You talk too much.

130
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,378
Don't you have stuff to do?
Finished writing lines?

131
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,465
Lines? Of course…

132
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,467
I haven't.

133
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:54,725
Attention.

134
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,143
Bow.

135
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,270
Good morning.

136
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,315
Today, I need to tell you

137
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,859
some bad news.

138
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,697
The school trip you missed last year
because of the typhoon,

139
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,825
you're going this year.

140
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:16,622
Quiet!

141
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,544
What kind of school sends seniors
on a school trip?

142
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,046
The school board has lost it.

143
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,883
So, for your lines assignment,

144
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:30,469
I want two notebooks a week.

145
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,388
-What?
-Oh no!

146
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,305
Please!

147
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,766
Over here.

148
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,726
I'm open!

149
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,106
-Wow.
-Nice one!

150
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,065
Good shot.

151
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,027
-Hey.
-Huh?

152
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,614
To Won-yeong!

153
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,408
-Right here.
-Pass it!

154
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,492
One more pass.

155
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:56,870
-Nice!
-All right.

156
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,248
I'm doing it.

157
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,749
Here you go.

158
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,418
Ma'am.

159
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,336
I'll take a Neverstop.

160
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,519
Could you keep this
for the tall boy playing--

161
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,645
Kim Hyun?

162
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,397
Yes! How did you know?

163
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:27,318
There are just too many SRs today.

164
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,362
Su-rin, Seong-ryeon, and now Se-ri.

165
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,491
Think of something unique
to catch his eye.

166
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,578
With all those, his bladder's gonna burst.

167
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,746
FOR HYUN
FROM JI-HYE

168
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,540
Can I have one?

169
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,334
It's hot.

170
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,422
Rock, paper, scissors.

171
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,840
-Loser eats this?
-Yeah.

172
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,301
Park Se-ri.

173
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,719
Flintstone.

174
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,765
Flintstone's real name is Ko In-jung.

175
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,433
Done some brushing today, have you?

176
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,686
The nickname
comes from her Bronze Age hairstyle.

177
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,813
Just calmed it down a bit.

178
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,486
Together, we used to straighten our hair
with pencil boards.

179
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,032
You're into Hyun too?

180
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,753
PARK SE-RI

181
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,609
"Park Se-ri."

182
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:54,571
It's a pretty name.

183
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,075
It suits you.

184
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,364
PARK SE-RI

185
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,905
Hey!

186
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,909
Help!

187
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,205
Hey, wake up!

188
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,123
You gotta be kidding me!

189
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,351
You okay?

190
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,728
Are you all right now?

191
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,692
You really scared me.

192
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,154
Why did you go in if you can't even swim?

193
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,242
What the hell?

194
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:12,000
Damn it! Stay out of the water, mister.
It's dangerous.

195
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,682
GARAM HIGH SCHOOL

196
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,684
FACULTY ROOM

197
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,143
I see, so that's what happened.

198
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,940
Don't distract others, though,
even if you're not taking the CSAT.

199
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,859
I know you're a year older,

200
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,944
but try to get along with everyone.

201
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,322
Breaking news! Someone's here!

202
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,575
This is huge!

203
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,660
You always say that.

204
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,414
-Guess what I saw in the faculty room.
-What? What is it?

205
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:02,175
Today, we have a new student
joining us all the way from Seoul.

206
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,094
-Seoul?
-Introduce yourself.

207
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,348
I'm Han Yun-seok.

208
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,268
That's it?

209
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,521
That's it.

210
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,358
Look at his leg.
Bet he caused trouble before coming here.

211
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,320
-Take the seat at the back.
-I heard he got held back a year.

212
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,530
What? He got held back?

213
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,365
Se-ri, what's all that jabber?

214
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,329
Yun-seok.

215
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,997
Don't cause trouble.

216
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,918
-And, all of you, be nice to him.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,878
How many days till the CSAT?

218
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,297
184 days.

219
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,840
What's our job as seniors?

220
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,759
Studying.

221
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,843
That's all.

222
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,358
We meet again.

223
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:00,817
Mister.

224
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,363
Yeah.

225
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,451
So this must be from yesterday.

226
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,335
Still, you're lucky I was there.
That was a close one.

227
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,753
Mister.

228
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:20,671
Right.

229
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,182
Hey, what was that? You know each other?

230
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,685
No. We met at the beach yesterday.

231
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,269
Huh? At the beach?

232
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,813
Doing what?

233
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,398
It's a long story.

234
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,483
You went there for Hyun?

235
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,196
-Right?
-No, I didn't.

236
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,489
-Come on.
-You did.

237
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,074
You definitely did!

238
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,535
-You didn't?
-I said no!

239
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,452
You did!

240
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,454
-Yes, you did.
-Just tell us.

241
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,937
Hey. Isn't that Sung-rae?

242
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,106
What is he doing?

243
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,406
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you creeping like that?

244
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,615
Look at Yun-seok.

245
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,453
Umbrella, bags, crutch.
He's got his hands full.

246
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,621
Then why don't you go help him?

247
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,416
Well, I don't really want to make a fuss.

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,587
Sung-rae, you are
the walking, talking fuss.

249
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,550
What? Come on!

250
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,845
You're getting all wet.

251
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,889
Mister.

252
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,018
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

253
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,770
We're gonna be late. Walk faster.

254
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,104
Please.

255
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,024
Look.

256
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,734
Now Se-ri is helping him.

257
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:10,781
Stop, you three.

258
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,908
Sung-rae, get over here.

259
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:18,163
Your buddy's struggling with a bad leg
in the rain,

260
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,874
and you look perfectly dry and cozy.

261
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,167
It's not like that--

262
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,044
Don't just stand there. Take his bag.

263
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,721
Se-ri, do you have anything to say?

264
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,599
Me?

265
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,896
It's just the rain.
You know me. I didn't get a perm.

266
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:43,939
Not that.

267
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,816
Your name tag.

268
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,860
What? Where did it go?

269
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,530
I put it on this morning, but it's gone.

270
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,490
You'd better have it on tomorrow

271
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,784
or I'm making you an appointment
for some extra curls.

272
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:56,868
Actually, I…

273
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:08,755
PILOT SITE FOR SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM
GARAM HIGH SCHOOL

274
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,305
Run!

275
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,266
Stop pushing!

276
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,436
Hey.

277
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,063
Over there.

278
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,231
Oh my.

279
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,275
He looks so helpless.

280
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,611
Why does he keep getting on my nerves?

281
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,246
Oppa.

282
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,497
Enjoy your meal.

283
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,375
He's our classmate.
What's with the formality?

284
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,252
But he's older, so he's an oppa.

285
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,796
There's no need.

286
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,132
See? Mister wants it that way.

287
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,510
Se-ri, you're one to talk.
Why do you call him "Mister"?

288
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,180
Yeah, you can just call him oppa.

289
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,099
Nah, I just can't say that, ever.

290
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:06,021
I've never said that my whole life.
I'm almost allergic to it.

291
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,357
Whatever's fine.

292
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,485
All right, Yun-seok.
Let's keep it casual around here.

293
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:13,987
Eat up.

294
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,239
Shall we do that, then?

295
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,617
I mean, can I?

296
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,079
By the way, oppa,
I heard Se-ri rescued you at the beach.

297
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,497
Huh?

298
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,082
That means she's your savior.

299
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,125
Right?

300
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,629
Yun-seok, I'm your lifesaver, aren't I?

301
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,506
I carried your umbrella earlier
and even grabbed your lunch.

302
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,843
Ice cream.

303
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:41,306
Ice cream!

304
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,391
-Thanks for the ice cream.
-Sure.

305
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,395
I'm not saying it because of this,
but you're kinda cool.

306
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,023
Hey, you barely even know him.

307
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,817
I heard you're ditching the CSAT.

308
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,694
How did you know?

309
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:55,862
Well, our teacher…

310
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,740
Anyway, you have my respect.

311
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,992
Giving up is never easy.

312
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,078
-Look at me. I can't let go.
-What's this?

313
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,246
Hold still.

314
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,247
PARK SE-RI

315
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,456
Wow, that looks real.

316
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,042
But, Se-ri,
what'd you really do with your name tag?

317
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,502
I wish I knew!

318
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,711
Maybe someone took it?

319
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,507
PARK SE-RI

320
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,468
They say keeping someone's name tag
makes them like you back.

321
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,387
Someone must have a crush on you.

322
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,721
She's right.

323
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:24,140
Someone must've taken it.

324
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,978
Someone's clearly holding on to it!

325
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,605
He's keeping it safe for you!

326
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,692
You really think someone took it?

327
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,987
Man, that makes it tough.
I'm already into Hyun.

328
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,657
What if he shows up with my name tag
and says he likes me?

329
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,499
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

330
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:54,629
Yeah.

331
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:57,048
Yes, well, I'm fine.

332
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,717
I'm so sorry.

333
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,302
-What are you doing?
-Hurry up!

334
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,636
I'm coming!

335
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,223
You're really okay, right? See you around.

336
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,268
Hey! Get it together, man!

337
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,895
Move up!

338
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,150
I think he knows what he's doing.

339
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,110
You saw him smile? That gaze was intense.

340
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,821
Are you serious? He was looking at me?

341
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,574
I'm telling you,
he was totally flirting with you.

342
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,618
Maybe he hit you on purpose
just to come over.

343
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,954
Right?

344
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,707
I don't think so.

345
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,922
What do you mean?

346
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,633
I just don't think he did it on purpose.

347
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,721
Oh yeah? Are your eyes that fast?

348
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,390
It was clearly an accident--

349
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,391
Hey!

350
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,478
Whatever. Se-ri, don't listen to him.

351
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,646
Forget it. What's his problem?

352
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,731
Let's go.

353
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,491
Can't you read the room, bro?

354
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,290
I heard Hyun's into Lee Hyo-ri.

355
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,458
Really?

356
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,044
Yeah, he prefers her to Sung Yu-ri.

357
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,462
It's the long, straight hair.

358
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,298
Hey! Se-ri!

359
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,967
Breaking news!

360
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:23,968
What is it?

361
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,054
I'm not in the mood right now.

362
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,555
She's got straight hair!

363
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,308
Oh, come on. You guys are on that too?

364
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,560
No, Flintstone came with straight hair!

365
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,729
What? Who? Flintstone?

366
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,106
You mean our Flintstone?

367
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,613
Flintstone?

368
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,674
Flintstone.

369
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,134
How…

370
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,386
how did you…

371
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,310
Oh, this? I got a straight perm.

372
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,939
I'm not buying it.
You've had them so many times before.

373
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,024
It's not just any straight perm.

374
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,401
Magic.

375
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,278
Magic straight perm.

376
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,574
What's more,
it's a Seoul magic straight perm.

377
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:36,708
Where?

378
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,211
Rose Hair Salon.

379
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:42,547
How much?

380
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,840
200,000.

381
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,177
What? 200,000 won?

382
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,099
SPECIAL DEAL
ALL LENGTHS 200,000 WON!

383
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,518
SEOUL MAGIC STRAIGHT
RAINPROOF AND NATURAL!

384
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,315
Hi there. Do you have any questions?

385
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,691
ROSE HAIR SALON

386
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,528
Yes, about the Seoul magic straight perm.

387
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:10,700
I've tried so many straight perms,
but they never lasted a day.

388
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,952
What's so different about this one?

389
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,205
What's different?

390
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,373
It's just a whole different process.

391
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,709
Different chemicals, different equipment.

392
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:24,589
It straightens your hair
like you were born with it.

393
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,634
But anyway,

394
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,719
your hair…

395
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,639
It's quite something.

396
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,392
Well, it's still doable.
Would you like to try it?

397
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,561
1000 WON

398
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,776
CONGRATS ON STARTING HIGH SCHOOL!
FROM DAD

399
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,352
ROSE HAIR SALON

400
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,566
Mom, let me help.

401
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,408
Go inside. I got this.

402
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,410
Let me help.

403
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,288
-"Mom"?
-It's fine, really.

404
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,205
Let's go in.

405
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,797
It's working!

406
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,967
What is?

407
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,010
Look.

408
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,179
It's all about the angle and spacing.

409
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,098
I should've tried this sooner.

410
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:01,144
"Wonder… ful."

411
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,771
"Ideas."

412
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:08,860
Amazing, isn't it?

413
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,278
-You want one?
-Yeah.

414
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,613
Want me to make you one?

415
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,697
Me too.

416
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,366
Not bad at all. It'll save time.

417
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:41,768
Yun-seok?

418
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,478
What are you doing here?

419
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,814
I was just passing by.

420
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:48,232
What about you?

421
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,068
Getting a haircut?

422
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,821
No. This is my mom's place.

423
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,367
Oh, really?

424
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,994
Well then, I guess I better say hello.

425
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,997
Wait!

426
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,124
Yun-seok, is that you?

427
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,502
Ma'am. Good afternoon.

428
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:08,878
Yun-seok…

429
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:13,174
I mean, oppa and I are in the same class.
My name is Park Se-ri.

430
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,678
The one with the crazy curls?

431
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,764
So you're friends with Yun-seok.

432
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,599
Yes, that's right.

433
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,352
You know I saved him
in the water, don't you?

434
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,353
What?

435
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,526
I mean, what if I hadn't been there?

436
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,112
Just thinking about it
makes my hands shake.

437
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,198
I wonder why he was in there
when he can't even swim.

438
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,199
Mom.

439
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,702
I didn't mean to go in. I just slipped.

440
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:42,787
I see.

441
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,747
You saved his life.

442
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:45,832
That's right.

443
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,208
I saved him.

444
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:52,046
You know, I literally risked my life
for Yun-seok that day.

445
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,051
Se-ri, was it?

446
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:02,056
Are you still interested
in that magic straight perm?

447
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,352
Of course I am! I'm more than interested.

448
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,437
I see.

449
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:08,771
You know,

450
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:12,024
it's been tough for Yun-seok
with that cast on his leg.

451
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,735
And he has no friends.

452
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:14,652
Pardon?

453
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,571
What do you mean?

454
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,032
We are super close! Aren't we?

455
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,785
Oppa is in good hands with me.

456
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,329
All right.

457
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:29,083
If you help him out till his cast's off,

458
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:32,712
then I'll think about
giving you that magic straight perm.

459
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,547
Really?

460
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,799
Yes, of course!
You have nothing to worry about.

461
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,301
-Okay.
-Leave it to me!

462
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,136
Hmm?

463
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,066
Wow, looks delicious.

464
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,151
I'm off!

465
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,446
-What about breakfast?
-It's fine. I'm busy!

466
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,031
-I can do it.
-Come on out.

467
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,699
-Good morning.
-Hi.

468
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,872
Can't you see he's injured?

469
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:09,791
Come on!

470
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,517
ROSE HAIR SALON
SEOUL MAGIC STRAIGHT PERM

471
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,686
Check out Rose Hair Salon.

472
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,940
Come to Rose Hair,
the best spot for straight perms.

473
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:35,650
Rose Hair Salon.

474
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,193
Try the Seoul magic straight.

475
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,111
Excuse me, Mr. Curls.

476
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,531
"Mr. Curls"?

477
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:45,618
Come here and your hair
will be straight as ever.

478
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,079
Why would I want to do that, huh?

479
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,455
It looks good.

480
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,332
No, I don't think you get it.

481
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,418
This Seoul magic straight
will actually straighten your hair.

482
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,795
I got this in Seoul.

483
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,755
Cost me 150,000 won.

484
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,013
What the…

485
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,143
You don't need to do this.

486
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,521
Hey, come on. Give them back.

487
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:14,605
Let go!

488
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,357
Give me that!

489
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,275
I said--

490
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,068
Oh no!

491
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,280
What are you doing?

492
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,781
Just stand still for a second.

493
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,577
-You okay?
-Maybe I broke my rib.

494
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,911
Should've played smarter.

495
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:33,124
Good thing I know how to land.
If it happened to you, you'd be dead.

496
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,626
Yeah, right. I'd have made the shot.

497
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,128
What are you talking about?

498
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,590
You think you can ball? Are you that good?

499
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:42,925
Hey.

500
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,510
Is he gone?

501
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,095
Huh?

502
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,771
Man, that was really close.

503
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:58,357
I can't let him see me looking like this.

504
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,527
Like what? You look the same.

505
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,030
Han Yun-seok.

506
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:05,823
We're in trouble.

507
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:07,867
-Darn it.
-What is it?

508
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,619
Follow me.

509
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,413
-Why? Where are we going?
-Hurry up!

510
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:19,754
Be careful.

511
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:39,398
Oh God!

512
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,817
Hey, are you all right?

513
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,153
Oh no. Your cast's soaked.

514
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,949
What's this place anyway?

515
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,368
This is my dad's storage room.

516
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,452
Wait.

517
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,250
Here.

518
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,717
You can get changed there. I won't look.

519
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,220
Is this yours?

520
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:12,974
No, that's my dad's.
Everything here is his.

521
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,524
Are you done?

522
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:25,403
Yeah.

523
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,245
All of this is your dad's too?

524
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:35,579
Yep.

525
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:39,083
Oh, except for this. This is my spot.

526
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,128
Do you like comic books?

527
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,087
No.

528
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,881
I mean,

529
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,758
I've just never read one.

530
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:48,801
What?

531
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,887
You've never read a comic book before?

532
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,848
That's right.

533
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,145
Hey.

534
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,440
I don't show these to just anyone.

535
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,233
Sit down.

536
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,862
They're my dad's, so no lending.
But you can come read sometimes.

537
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,030
I'll allow it.

538
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,740
No, I'm fine.

539
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:12,950
Hey, Yun-seok.

540
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:17,830
Seriously, you cannot miss out on this.

541
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,552
Here.

542
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,478
For God's sake.

543
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:44,273
You have a long way to go.
You should come by more to read.

544
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,900
The padlock combination here is

545
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,735
four, eight, six.

546
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:48,652
What?

547
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,697
-Four, eight, six?
-Hey, keep it down!

548
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,032
Someone could hear you.

549
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,785
Who? There's someone else here?

550
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,997
No, I mean we don't want
anyone else knowing it's 486 too.

551
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,124
-Two? 4862?
-No.

552
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,335
No, it's not 4862!

553
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:05,795
Come on!

554
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,089
Give me your hand.
I'll write it down for you.

555
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:10,508
No, I got it. It's 486.

556
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,093
Hey! Shush!

557
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,429
Make sure you keep this a secret.

558
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,681
Only my dad and I come here.

559
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,517
Especially Sung-rae.

560
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,269
If he ever finds out, it'll all be over.

561
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:26,440
Ugh, my ears still hurt because of him.

562
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,539
GO FOR HYUN'S HEART

563
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,082
First of all, thank you all so much…

564
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,084
OPERATION
"LOVE CONFESSION IN SELF-STUDY ROOM"

565
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:48,003
…for taking part
in the biggest moment of my life.

566
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,548
Don't be silly, girl. No way I'd miss it.

567
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,133
We're friends, aren't we?

568
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:55,594
Here.

569
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,892
-This is how you fold it, right?
-Yeah.

570
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,936
What are we doing?

571
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,187
What else?

572
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,857
Oh-my-Seri is going to ask Hyun out.

573
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,067
You can fold crane eggs, can't you?

574
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:11,986
Crane eggs?

575
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,446
Crane's eggs?

576
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,365
Crane eggs.

577
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,287
We'll fold each with all our hearts
and make exactly 1,000.

578
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,621
You think 1,000 is enough?

579
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:25,416
Mi-jin from the next class
folded 1,000 cranes, not eggs.

580
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,251
Then we'll make 10,000.

581
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:28,669
-What?
-10,000?

582
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,587
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

583
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,005
-Not possible.
-We can do it!

584
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,381
-Too many.
-Sounds great.

585
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,216
-No, it doesn't.
-You fold 1,000.

586
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,217
-No.
-Let's do it.

587
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,719
Yun-seok.

588
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,596
Where are you going?

589
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,766
Don't you realize
how big your role is here?

590
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,727
My role?

591
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,644
Yes.

592
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,900
"Seoul magic straight perm.
Han Yun-seok in charge."

593
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,987
But I'm not good at paper folding--

594
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,780
You're our friend, aren't you?

595
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:57,698
That's right.

596
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,618
I guess Seoul kids
are all about themselves.

597
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:03,078
No, it's fine. Let him go.

598
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,956
He's probably super busy
with something else.

599
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,876
This is what I get for saving his life.

600
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,628
-Uh-oh.
-Oh dear.

601
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:11,921
It's all right.

602
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,339
Now,

603
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,132
from here,

604
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:17,218
make one more triangle.

605
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,220
Hey, that's a good-looking triangle.

606
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,602
-Read it aloud. "Until."
-"Until."

607
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,647
"I didn't know what I wanted
until I met you."

608
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,734
"I didn't know what I wanted
until I met you."

609
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:35,903
"Until" is a conjunction…

610
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,532
When did you fold so many?

611
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,213
Hey!

612
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,471
Was I walking too fast? Sorry.

613
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:05,599
It's okay.

614
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:06,767
Rock, paper, scissors!

615
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,145
Rock, paper, scissors!

616
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,652
You owe me three notebooks next week.

617
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,112
Wait, sir.

618
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,196
Please.

619
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,365
You want four?

620
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,787
Han Yun-seok.

621
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:31,292
Why aren't you turning in your lines?

622
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,836
Oh, I hurt my leg, so--

623
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,588
And you lost your mind too?

624
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,717
Do you write with your foot?

625
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,678
BAEK SUNG-RAE

626
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,637
Bro.

627
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,640
No reasoning with him. He's the law.

628
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,268
Hey, why not?

629
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:52,104
It could mess with my exams.
What are you gonna do then?

630
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,939
It's just one day.

631
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:57,401
Do you know how much each day matters
to the school's top student?

632
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,070
Shoot.

633
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,864
Hwang Sang-cheol.

634
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:05,868
Switch with me just once.
It's really important.

635
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,996
I said no! It's not happening!

636
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:12,082
I really wasn't gonna say this,

637
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,335
but do you think he'll say yes?

638
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,462
You think Hyun's that desperate?

639
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,298
Wake up.

640
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,426
You must know
you're just not on his level.

641
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:27,097
What's that chalk-covered nerd
rambling about?

642
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,223
He must be insane!

643
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:33,270
Someone needs to switch seats with her
to ask Hyun out in the self-study room.

644
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,272
What a jerk move.

645
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,649
-What's he got besides good grades?
-Ignore him.

646
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,946
Hand me my bag. I'll carry it.

647
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:55,084
I can carry it myself, you know.

648
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,088
Thanks.

649
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,839
Wait.

650
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,224
Here.

651
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,439
Se-ri.

652
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,859
Are you crying?

653
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,864
I mean,

654
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:29,284
who does Sang-cheol think he is?

655
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:31,995
Hey…

656
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:38,544
Look…

657
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,008
You forgot this.

658
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,053
I don't care. Go inside.

659
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:53,100
JUNE MOCK EXAM FOR 1999 CSAT

660
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:11,785
Han Yun-seok.

661
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,164
Are you taking the mock exam?

662
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,498
Yes.

663
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,417
All right.

664
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:32,890
Finished?

665
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,475
Yes.

666
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,963
I thought you said you don't read comics.

667
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,091
You told me to.

668
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:27,694
What are you doing?

669
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,820
What do you think?

670
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,532
I'm praying with all my heart and soul.

671
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:33,742
But it's already submitted.

672
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,870
Be quiet.

673
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:38,664
I'm being serious right now.

674
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,970
Honestly,

675
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,639
I don't know what I'll do with my life.

676
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,017
There's nothing I'm good at
or really like.

677
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,769
That's not true.

678
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,731
There's something you're good at.

679
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:06,567
What?

680
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,235
Swimming.

681
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:10,821
Well, I guess so.

682
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:12,948
That's how I met Hyun too.

683
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,326
Seriously,

684
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,664
the second I get my hair straightened,
I swear I'm gonna tell Hyun how I feel.

685
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:24,251
Is straight hair necessary?

686
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,044
Of course.

687
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:28,297
Who on earth would like this hair?

688
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,354
Hey.

689
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:47,065
What's this?

690
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:49,568
You filled up the whole thing?

691
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,074
I don't know what to say.

692
00:42:56,158 --> 00:43:00,162
I don't get why
this is so important, but sure.

693
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,707
Of course it's important.
It means everything.

694
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,001
But these are useless in the end.

695
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,587
Han Yun-seok,

696
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,714
this is your problem.

697
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,008
Does it have to be useful
to mean something?

698
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:19,139
There's a bit of everyone's heart in here.
Me, you, and the guys.

699
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:25,646
Even if Hyun rejects me,
the times we shared will stay in here.

700
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:29,024
But, of course,
Hyun wouldn't do that to me.

701
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:37,824
All right. I shall also give you a gift.

702
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,954
Pretty, isn't it?
You can use it to write your lines.

703
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,124
But our teacher's just ridiculous.

704
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:48,251
Why is he making you write lines too?

705
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:53,006
Yeah. I've done lots of weird stuff
since I moved here.

706
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,097
Yun-seok.

707
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,265
You…

708
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,560
you got your cast off!

709
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:08,355
-Yeah.
-Congratulations, Yun-seok!

710
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,482
I mean, oppa.

711
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:11,942
Hello, Se-ri.

712
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,735
Good morning.

713
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,821
Thanks for all your hard work.

714
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:18,156
Do you want to come by and get your perm?

715
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,158
I'll do it for free.

716
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:21,118
What?

717
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:22,661
Really?

718
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,871
You're really going to do it for free?

719
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,959
Thank you so much!

720
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,044
-Shall we do it today?
-Oh, well…

721
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:34,423
Not today. I'll come by when I'm prepared.

722
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,216
"Prepared"?

723
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,552
Oh, it's nothing.

724
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,728
Hey, what's going on?

725
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,188
Se-ri, look.

726
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:51,898
What is it?

727
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:53,817
What?

728
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,360
"Han Yun-seok"?

729
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:56,862
Hey!

730
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:58,697
Yun-seok.

731
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,949
What's that all about?

732
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,493
You needed a spot in the study room.

733
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:04,411
What?

734
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,081
Oh my God!

735
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,375
You're freaking awesome!

736
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:13,962
You're seriously the best, for real!

737
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,341
What? Aren't you guys glad?

738
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,259
What's wrong?

739
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,428
Well, it's not that.

740
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,514
It looks like Hyun got bumped out.

741
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,268
I can't find his name anywhere.

742
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:37,861
100TH PLACE, SON HAE-GYO

743
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,289
He was just trying to help you.

744
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,015
-Bok-hee.
-Hi.

745
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,934
-You busy?
-Not at all.

746
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:10,143
Have some of this.

747
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:13,522
You shouldn't have. Thanks for this.

748
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,982
Did you hear about Jang-mi
from down the street?

749
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:16,900
Rose Hair?

750
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,694
Everyone's making a fuss
about her son topping the exam.

751
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:23,573
Yeah, but I also heard
he's not taking the CSAT.

752
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,868
Life's unfair, isn't it?

753
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:27,786
Exactly.

754
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:32,666
They say her husband's a professor
at Seongbuk University Hospital in Seoul,

755
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,960
and his family is a big deal.

756
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,461
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

757
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:38,922
Then what are the two of them
doing way out here?

758
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,466
He was pathologically jealous of his wife,

759
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,178
and he bullied his kid,
never happy with anything he did.

760
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:46,805
But he's such a good kid.

761
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:47,806
I know.

762
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,518
Hurt deep down,
he couldn't settle at his old school,

763
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:55,355
and the stress has him
sitting out this year's CSAT.

764
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,566
Oh dear.

765
00:46:58,275 --> 00:47:00,402
Apparently, Jang-mi's sister
lives in America,

766
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,237
and she wants her to come.

767
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:13,957
Yun-seok?

768
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:15,917
Se-ri, you're here.

769
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,961
Dad?

770
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:19,421
What?

771
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,299
Yun-seok.

772
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,926
What are you doing there?

773
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,637
Oh, I made him stay for some ramyeon.

774
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:29,431
Ramyeon?

775
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:35,562
Let's see.

776
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,190
So,

777
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:40,859
about earlier…

778
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,236
Sorry for storming off like that.

779
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:44,613
It's okay.

780
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,159
By the way,
I guess you're smarter than you look.

781
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,411
Smarter than I look?

782
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:54,247
Yun-seok, do you like taking pictures?

783
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,458
-Pardon me?
-Here.

784
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,918
These are disposable cameras.

785
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,878
You can come and take as many as you need.

786
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,796
There's a ton back there.

787
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,341
My dad runs a photo studio.

788
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:07,052
Se-ri, did you guess well on the test?

789
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:11,181
Dad, don't say that.
I'm already feeling down about the exam.

790
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,309
What for? You never do well on exams.

791
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,896
Dad, stop.
Don't you have any expectations of me?

792
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,814
Of course I do.

793
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:21,650
Just not about your grades.

794
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:25,695
That's the same as nothing.
But you expect a lot from Hye-ri.

795
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:29,115
Tell me, has Hye-ri ever gotten you
a glass of water?

796
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,283
-Never.
-Exactly.

797
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,160
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

798
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,787
That's why you're the best!

799
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,705
-Right?
-Right.

800
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:47,300
Stop pulling your hair down.
You'll have no hair left to straighten.

801
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,720
Just let me have this.
Hyun's gonna be there too.

802
00:48:50,804 --> 00:48:53,014
Hey, so how will you ask Hyun out?

803
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,768
That's the thing. What do I do?

804
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:01,564
Give her a break.
You're stressing her out.

805
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:03,483
Well, I didn't mean to.

806
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,777
It's a shame
after everything we've prepared.

807
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,945
Don't you agree?

808
00:49:08,697 --> 00:49:09,990
School trip.

809
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:11,616
What did you say?

810
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,536
I can do it on our school trip.

811
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:18,331
I like it. It will have a campfire
and the perfect vibe.

812
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:20,417
And we'll be out of our uniforms.

813
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,139
Coming through, guys.

814
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:37,017
Why are you coming this way?
Not going to PE?

815
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,227
I gotta leave this with the teacher first.

816
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,520
What is it?

817
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,318
-What's this?
-What's this?

818
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,405
Oh my. It's so pretty.

819
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:52,532
Hey!

820
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,117
No touching.

821
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:57,620
My aunt sent it to me from America,
and it's expensive.

822
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:01,374
If you're that worried,
just stay here and look after it yourself.

823
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,835
No, we're playing buddyball today.

824
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,671
I love playing buddyball.

825
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,888
Stop dawdling, and, everyone, partner up.

826
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,599
If the person wearing the vest
gets hit, both are out.

827
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,309
Want to team up with me?

828
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,478
How dare you, Flintstone.

829
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:24,481
Sure. Go get a vest. I'll be the thrower.

830
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:28,777
What?

831
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,154
Be my buddy?

832
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:34,741
Okay, sure.

833
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:37,786
Who's attacking first?
I need one from each side.

834
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:40,288
All right.

835
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:42,624
You guys?

836
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:46,795
You.

837
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:47,796
Hey.

838
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:50,882
-Me?
-Yeah.

839
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,433
Here we go.

840
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,895
What?

841
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,940
In front of you.

842
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,408
Guard the vests!

843
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,043
Catch!

844
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:36,511
Are you insane?

845
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,639
Wait, I wasn't really trying to dodge it.

846
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:49,649
Seriously?
Why is she glued to him like that?

847
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:02,579
Nice!

848
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:05,915
Hey! Over there!

849
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:10,545
-Here!
-Sol-ji, shield me!

850
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,179
Go, Class 7!

851
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,890
Class 7!

852
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,350
-Get Se-ri!
-Watch your arm.

853
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,814
-Behind!
-Nice!

854
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:30,899
Nice!

855
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:33,109
Sung-rae,
you did that on purpose, didn't you?

856
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:34,986
Over here!

857
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,263
Oh-my-Seri, you okay?

858
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:45,306
-She's fine!
-What were you thinking?

859
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,141
-Head inside, all of you.
-Shit!

860
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,768
Everyone inside.

861
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,899
Crap.

862
00:53:56,776 --> 00:54:00,405
Oh man.

863
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,198
Come on!

864
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,578
Seriously, why did I do that?

865
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,419
Yun-seok, this is Se-ri.

866
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:17,380
What are you up to? Are you well?

867
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,676
Man…

868
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,814
Yun-seok, this is Se-ri.

869
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,775
I'm sorry about earlier.

870
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:43,906
You know, it wasn't on purpose.
I don't know why I did that.

871
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:47,785
But I felt safe behind you.

872
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,458
Wait, what? What am I saying?

873
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,753
I can't with this.

874
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,219
Who's this?

875
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:14,395
You have one message.

876
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,147
Se-ri.

877
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:18,441
This is Hyun from Class 4.

878
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:21,736
Today was fun.

879
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,156
But that must've hurt.

880
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,658
You saved me out there.

881
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,118
Thanks.

882
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:31,079
I'll see you around.

883
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,551
You have one message.

884
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,097
Hey, it's Yun-seok.

885
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,973
How's your face?

886
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,727
I feel bad just leaving you like that.

887
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:58,106
I'm not mad at you, so don't worry.

888
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:02,902
Don't go rubbing eggs on that bruise.

889
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,029
You could get salmonella.

890
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,991
Get some ointment instead.
It'll heal faster that way.

891
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,453
All right. See you tomorrow.

892
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:14,330
Bye.

893
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,013
YOUTH RETREAT CENTER FACILITY MAP

894
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,222
-We'll take this path.
-Right.

895
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:14,849
The problem is getting the power.

896
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,100
Then, Ha-young,

897
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:18,352
you guys set up this area.

898
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,104
The main thing is getting power.

899
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:22,440
-I'll get it from right here.
-Hey!

900
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:24,400
-Come on.
-Don't ruin it.

901
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,568
Guys.

902
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,533
-Dang, girl.
-Yikes.

903
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,202
-How'd you even…
-It's fine.

904
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:35,661
I'm all right.

905
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:36,954
Anyway, where were we?

906
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:37,872
Here.

907
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,415
-Electricity.
-That's right.

908
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:41,167
Where can we get it from?

909
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,084
Thanks.

910
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:43,753
-From here?
-Well…

911
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,004
I'll take care of it.

912
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:47,965
Sung-rae, you know,
you're a real pro at this.

913
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,676
If this works,
Hyun's gonna be so into you.

914
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,304
You picked out baby names?
Better start thinking now.

915
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:54,305
Hey.

916
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,806
I'll catch you guys later.

917
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:58,059
You're leaving?

918
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:59,477
-Bro.
-We've just started.

919
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,729
-We have a job for you too.
-Okay.

920
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:05,316
All right, then, you can't complain later!

921
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,488
That's Park Chan-ho!

922
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:14,784
MOBILE GRADUATION PHOTO STUDIO

923
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,118
Three, two, one.

924
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,204
Great.

925
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:20,456
-Hey, look at you.
-That's a villain's beard.

926
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,000
-So pointy.
-What's that on your chin?

927
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,585
-Ahem!
-Is that seaweed?

928
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:28,965
My goodness,
look what her dad made her wear.

929
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,635
Golfer Pak Se-ri and her caddie!

930
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,806
Look, like this.

931
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,224
Fists in the air.

932
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:39,308
Good.

933
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:40,893
Take your socks off.

934
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:42,353
Take them off.

935
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,646
Oh, come on.

936
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,356
Dad, is this really necessary?

937
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:48,568
Seriously…

938
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:52,113
Give me a break.

939
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,450
Why is Dad making me do this?

940
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:58,703
Ugh.

941
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:01,289
God, I hate my hair.

942
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,249
Well, I like it.

943
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,794
Ready?

944
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,425
All right, here we go.
Let's see that pose.

945
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:15,344
Mr. Caddie.

946
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:17,722
-You gotta celebrate with her.
-Bigger smile!

947
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:20,016
-Okay.
-All right, look happy!

948
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,517
What's wrong with your face?

949
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:23,102
You're excited!

950
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,228
Good!

951
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,112
Hello.

952
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,739
Hi, Se-ri.

953
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:37,074
-It's hot.
-Oops. I'm sorry.

954
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:39,076
Are you okay? My goodness.

955
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,286
Se-ri.

956
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,622
I'm just so busy at the moment.

957
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:44,874
Can you go sit in the shampoo chair
for now?

958
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,375
Okay.

959
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,338
Oops. I didn't see that.

960
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,131
That must have hurt.

961
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,049
All right.

962
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,136
Yun-seok!

963
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,138
Can you shampoo Se-ri for me?

964
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:00,640
What?

965
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,642
You want him to do it?

966
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,852
He's pretty good at it.

967
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:09,607
I'm really sorry.

968
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:21,327
Okay.

969
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,163
Here I go.

970
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,925
Sorry.

971
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:36,842
You okay?

972
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,020
Here I go again.

973
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:49,605
Okay.

974
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:05,079
All done.

975
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:08,582
Have a good day.

976
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:11,836
You must be so happy with it.
It turned out perfectly.

977
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:14,046
-Do you mean it?
-Of course.

978
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,174
I guess I'll take this out for a spin.
Oh yeah.

979
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:19,552
-I feel good.
-Come again. No washing today!

980
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:20,636
All right.

981
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:22,221
Okay.

982
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:28,060
Did he get a Seoul magic straight too?

983
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:29,353
Sure, of course.

984
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:32,815
I see.

985
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,734
Wait, what's going on here?

986
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,235
This is odd.

987
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:37,695
Huh?

988
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:39,697
Yun-seok.

989
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,742
Did you use conditioner on her?

990
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:45,202
Oh, did I?

991
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:47,955
You weren't supposed to do that!

992
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,623
The perm won't take now.

993
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,167
Really?

994
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,044
Don't act clueless.
You know better than I do.

995
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:58,215
This isn't like you at all.
What were you thinking?

996
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,259
Mom, I'll be back in a bit.

997
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,970
Wait, where are you going?

998
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,680
What's gotten into him?

999
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:09,810
Se-ri, sorry about that.
I'll wash your hair again.

1000
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:11,187
Hurry now.

1001
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:14,356
Come on, hurry.

1002
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:20,863
Quiet!

1003
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,410
Anyone heard from Se-ri?

1004
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:29,413
There, she's coming!

1005
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:04,990
-So pretty!
-It's amazing!

1006
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,659
Hey, the curls are completely gone!

1007
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,370
It's, like, crazy smooth.

1008
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,586
Looks great. It's worth the money.

1009
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:23,467
You're just too idealistic

1010
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:28,514
Your gaze alone
Won't get a girl to make a move

1011
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:31,934
Girls like that don't exist
And I'm no different

1012
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,187
Just like this

1013
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,663
Hello!

1014
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:53,664
Nice to see you.

1015
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,416
-Mr. Park, hello.
-Hi!

1016
01:03:57,585 --> 01:03:59,378
Look over here. That's it!

1017
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:17,897
-That's enough.
-Wait, just one more.

1018
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,357
Take one with Won-yeong.

1019
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:25,195
Three, two, one.

1020
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,781
Okay! Three, two, one!

1021
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,506
"Letter to my parents."

1022
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,928
"Mother, Father, it's me, Sang-cheol."

1023
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:53,098
"I know things have been tough."

1024
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,770
"Not realizing how hard
last year's economy hit us,

1025
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:01,815
I just kept whining
and made it harder on you."

1026
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:04,276
"Mother, Father."

1027
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:08,697
"You always say sorry to me."

1028
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,952
"But you've done nothing wrong."

1029
01:05:29,468 --> 01:05:31,220
-He's here.
-Yeah.

1030
01:05:37,685 --> 01:05:38,602
Hey!

1031
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:41,105
It's beautiful.

1032
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:44,358
Good work. It's lovely.

1033
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:45,776
Oppa.

1034
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,236
The blanket.

1035
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:52,282
Right. Yes.

1036
01:05:58,914 --> 01:05:59,790
Se-ri.

1037
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,041
Are you ready?

1038
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:02,918
Stay focused.

1039
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:04,586
You can do this. You look amazing.

1040
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,171
-You've got this.
-So pretty.

1041
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:07,423
-You hear me?
-Give it.

1042
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:11,218
"I will repay every last bit."

1043
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:13,554
"Thank you,

1044
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:15,764
and I'm sorry."

1045
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:16,807
You startled me.

1046
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,600
-"I love you."
-Follow me.

1047
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:19,518
Why?

1048
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:23,105
"Even in another life,
I'd choose to be your son."

1049
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,404
-Quickly.
-What?

1050
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,408
Hello, everyone.

1051
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:39,246
I'm Garam High's official photographer,
Park Hong-il.

1052
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:45,586
Go that way.

1053
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:48,338
-That way?
-Yeah.

1054
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:18,869
I'm back.

1055
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,621
-Come.
-Scoot over.

1056
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:22,873
Sit down.

1057
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,884
I wonder who put all these lights up.

1058
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:39,098
It's pretty.

1059
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,100
Yeah.

1060
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:45,479
I like your new hair.

1061
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:56,740
The crane eggs.

1062
01:07:57,825 --> 01:07:58,909
That was you, right?

1063
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,204
How did you know?

1064
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:05,082
The jar had "Park Hong-il"
written on the bottom.

1065
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,667
Isn't that your dad?

1066
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:08,335
It was cute.

1067
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:11,088
When you blocked that ball for me too.

1068
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,423
Man, you were super athletic.

1069
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,717
Right. Yeah.

1070
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,680
I should've known when I saw you
swimming that well at our beach.

1071
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:21,682
"Our beach"?

1072
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,227
Only you and I know that spot.

1073
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,732
What are they saying?

1074
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:31,650
Don't know.

1075
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:34,194
-Can you hear them?
-No.

1076
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:47,499
So

1077
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,003
did you want to say something to me?

1078
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,758
Yes, I did.

1079
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:58,093
That's right.

1080
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:04,016
Well, say it. You're making me nervous.

1081
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,230
-What's happening?
-Huh?

1082
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:11,356
What are they saying?

1083
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,317
Shush, I can't hear them.

1084
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:20,908
Ah, with our love

1085
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,536
Hyun.

1086
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:25,996
Yeah?

1087
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:30,125
I liked you a lot.

1088
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,546
Because of you, I got a straight perm

1089
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:37,257
and made those crane eggs too.

1090
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,385
But,

1091
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:44,932
now that I'm here in front of you,

1092
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:47,768
I can't stop thinking about someone else.

1093
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,979
And bring light within

1094
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:55,067
Ah, with our love…

1095
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:58,445
They're leaving.

1096
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,030
Let's go.

1097
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:04,743
Forever unchanging

1098
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:11,208
We'll reach out to dark places…

1099
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,125
Did you tell him?

1100
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:13,961
You guys dating now?

1101
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,255
I dunno, stop asking.

1102
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:17,673
Why?

1103
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:19,258
What happened?

1104
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,635
Be quiet. We'll get in trouble.

1105
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:28,433
Ah, with our love

1106
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:33,814
Forever unchanging

1107
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:40,153
I always thought I had to change
for someone to like me.

1108
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:45,242
Like I needed to be better and prettier.

1109
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:47,744
But

1110
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:52,332
I don't think about any of that
when I'm with him.

1111
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,543
Is that right?

1112
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:04,761
Wow.

1113
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:07,597
I don't know who it is,
but I'm jealous of him.

1114
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:13,645
You must like him a lot.

1115
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:18,567
You think so?

1116
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:57,165
Uh, I got Audition Vol. 2 for you.

1117
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:00,127
Okay.

1118
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:08,051
I've got studying to do, so you go ahead.

1119
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:10,762
AUDITION

1120
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:13,849
But you can't take it home.

1121
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:16,143
I'll dive into it after the exam.

1122
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:29,865
Darn it.

1123
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:33,535
My hair keeps falling.
I don't know what to do with it.

1124
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:50,552
Yun-seok.

1125
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:56,266
Don't you have any questions for me?

1126
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:01,480
About what?

1127
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:04,316
About me and Hyun.

1128
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,068
You're not curious?

1129
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,906
How did it go?

1130
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:13,366
Well,

1131
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:14,993
I didn't ask him.

1132
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:21,791
Why not?

1133
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:25,545
Well,

1134
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,380
I need to study.

1135
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:34,763
Don't tell the others though.
They'll be disappointed.

1136
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,015
All right.

1137
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,895
And, Yun-seok…

1138
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:47,400
can you buy me a giant taffy
to wish me luck for my exam?

1139
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,782
You think bigger taffy
means better scores?

1140
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:55,784
Man, you're so…

1141
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,286
All right, just read your comic book.

1142
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,247
Seriously.

1143
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:07,754
8 DAYS UNTIL THE CSAT

1144
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,091
Hey.

1145
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:14,553
Stop distracting me. I'm studying.

1146
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:18,014
Forget studying.
It's time to practice guessing.

1147
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:23,395
I could've studied more
if we didn't have to do lines.

1148
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:28,525
I just want it all to be over.

1149
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:32,529
I want to go see the ocean.
It's so pretty in winter.

1150
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:37,200
If it snows,
it'll look like Flintstone's snow globe.

1151
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:41,246
You live right by the ocean,
and you're not tired of it?

1152
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,748
And have you ever seen snow in Busan?

1153
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:46,793
Still, it's possible.

1154
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:55,635
Hey.

1155
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,055
Isn't that Yun-seok?

1156
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:00,890
What?

1157
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:03,893
That looks like Flintstone.

1158
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,871
Where did you find something like that?

1159
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:25,206
Oh, Se-ri asked for a big one.

1160
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:27,792
Is it too big?

1161
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,462
The bigger, the better.

1162
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:36,509
Maybe I'll try the CSAT next year.

1163
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:40,055
Really?

1164
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:48,104
I thought you just hated the idea.

1165
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:51,316
I don't know.

1166
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,485
I think I can take it now.

1167
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:00,116
What?

1168
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,414
Here.

1169
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:08,583
What is this?

1170
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:10,794
You asked for a giant taffy.

1171
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:17,008
Right.

1172
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,010
Thanks.

1173
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:29,020
Hey! Yun-seok!

1174
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:32,607
Um…

1175
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:34,192
Are you

1176
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,278
and Flintstone close?

1177
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,781
Flintstone?

1178
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:44,202
No.

1179
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:48,039
Then why are you two hanging out?

1180
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:56,423
What, can't I hang out
with a school friend?

1181
01:17:56,506 --> 01:18:00,468
Friend? Since when were you two friends?

1182
01:18:02,971 --> 01:18:04,639
Se-ri, good luck tomorrow.

1183
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:07,934
Hey, wait!

1184
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:09,853
You've got this!

1185
01:18:10,437 --> 01:18:11,271
Hey!

1186
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:13,314
Han Yun-seok!

1187
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:19,279
Seriously, what the heck?

1188
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:27,704
Se-ri.

1189
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:29,080
-Here.
-I'm really sorry.

1190
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,416
There's no way I can go today.

1191
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:33,918
Dad, it's fine. How old do you think I am?

1192
01:18:34,002 --> 01:18:36,254
Mine is close by, so I can go alone.

1193
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,797
Didn't I tell you?

1194
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:41,009
I said don't eat that
because it might've gone bad.

1195
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:44,637
Se-ri, should I take you there?

1196
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,682
It's okay, really. Just go with Hye-ri.

1197
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:49,768
Too bad it's not the same test site.

1198
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:51,352
Good luck, Hye-ri.

1199
01:18:51,436 --> 01:18:52,896
-Thanks.
-Be right back.

1200
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:54,105
All right. See you.

1201
01:18:54,189 --> 01:18:56,399
Aim for the top!

1202
01:18:56,483 --> 01:18:57,442
COLLEGE MEANS DATING

1203
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:58,526
Nothing can stop you!

1204
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,861
Good luck.

1205
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,697
GOOD LUCK WITH THE EXAM
GET A PERFECT SCORE

1206
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:04,449
1999 COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST

1207
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:06,242
You got this!

1208
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:08,995
You got this!

1209
01:19:24,344 --> 01:19:25,637
I'm sorry.

1210
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:42,904
Go crush it!

1211
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:45,406
Hey!

1212
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:50,954
Se-ri,

1213
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,413
good luck with the exam.

1214
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,416
Okay, thanks.

1215
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,005
Oops.

1216
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,391
You've got this!

1217
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:22,986
Two times two is four.

1218
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:24,112
-So…
-Yes!

1219
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,197
…the answer is four.

1220
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:28,741
Goodness, how long will this last?

1221
01:20:28,825 --> 01:20:32,036
Gosh, that's just great for our trip.

1222
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,621
Show some pity, will you?

1223
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:40,420
Se-ri.

1224
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:46,342
Aren't you gonna…
check the answers at all?

1225
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:49,345
Every six months, the interest…

1226
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:54,976
I think I skipped a line
in my answer sheet!

1227
01:20:55,643 --> 01:20:56,477
Hey.

1228
01:20:56,978 --> 01:21:01,649
It's all right. Who knows?
Maybe you scored higher that way.

1229
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,487
You're right.

1230
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:17,373
Everyone,

1231
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:19,459
you've done well.

1232
01:21:21,628 --> 01:21:25,548
And for those of you who think
writing lines cost you the exam,

1233
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:29,135
I was just helping with an excuse.

1234
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,970
You would've wrecked it anyway.

1235
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:32,305
Well,

1236
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:34,766
you can't change the results now.

1237
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:36,267
So from now on,

1238
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:38,269
have all the fun you want.

1239
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:40,396
Yes, sir!

1240
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,359
If you're interested,
come to the jokbal alley by seven.

1241
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:47,779
Jokbal!

1242
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,285
How about some tteokbokki
to raise our spirits?

1243
01:21:54,369 --> 01:21:55,495
Sounds good.

1244
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:58,998
I can't believe
food is on your mind even now.

1245
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:00,124
Of course.

1246
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:01,834
Hey, actually,

1247
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:04,545
I gotta go do some stuff for my mom.

1248
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:05,630
You're not eating?

1249
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:06,589
No.

1250
01:22:06,673 --> 01:22:07,507
Okay.

1251
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,050
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

1252
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:13,972
I've got some stuff to do too.
You guys go ahead.

1253
01:22:14,055 --> 01:22:14,889
Really?

1254
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:16,224
That's a bummer.

1255
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,601
-I know.
-See you!

1256
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:41,874
Se-ri.

1257
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:46,254
What was that?

1258
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:15,575
Walk a bit more?

1259
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:18,286
Shall we?

1260
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:20,079
Okay.

1261
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,042
Let's race!

1262
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,960
Hey, wait for me!

1263
01:23:30,548 --> 01:23:31,549
Whoa!

1264
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,387
You're pretty fast.

1265
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,139
Careful.

1266
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:43,644
Hey.

1267
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:52,945
Do you remember I saved you right here?

1268
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:54,947
-Of course I do.
-Yeah?

1269
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:58,534
Seriously, what were you thinking
when you jumped in here?

1270
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,246
Honestly?

1271
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:06,459
That day,

1272
01:24:07,835 --> 01:24:11,172
I was thinking about what would happen
if those waves took me.

1273
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:15,510
I was having a really hard time.

1274
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:21,933
But then, funnily enough,

1275
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,393
I saw someone swimming there.

1276
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:29,440
She was having so much fun.

1277
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:45,081
PARK SE-RI

1278
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:47,458
-Where did you--
-I was holding onto it.

1279
01:24:48,543 --> 01:24:50,586
To remember the person who saved me.

1280
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:57,176
I'm so glad it was you, Se-ri.

1281
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:16,112
Se-ri.

1282
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:24,245
I like you.

1283
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:59,113
We're here again.

1284
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:01,908
Yeah.

1285
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:09,373
Hey,

1286
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,710
what are you doing on Sunday?

1287
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:16,923
I'll be seeing you.

1288
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,928
Oh, is that so?

1289
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:24,388
Okay.

1290
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:26,307
I'll see you then.

1291
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:57,523
Mom.

1292
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:58,941
Oh.

1293
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:00,651
Hi.

1294
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:06,699
Looks like
I need to go to Seoul on Sunday.

1295
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,160
Why all of a sudden?

1296
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:12,038
I heard there's new equipment
at the suppliers' in Seoul.

1297
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:15,541
You know I'm nothing without my equipment.

1298
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,543
Want me to come with you?

1299
01:28:18,044 --> 01:28:18,878
No.

1300
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:22,006
People will wonder why the shop's closed.

1301
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:24,842
You should stay and explain to them.

1302
01:28:25,343 --> 01:28:26,385
Okay.

1303
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:28,929
Do we have everything?

1304
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:33,059
I'm off now. Take care of Busan for me.

1305
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:36,771
Don't worry. Busan's in safe hands.

1306
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:39,231
That's reassuring.

1307
01:28:39,315 --> 01:28:41,108
Se-ri, hurry up!

1308
01:28:41,192 --> 01:28:42,818
See you on Sunday.

1309
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:44,779
Okay. Enjoy your trip.

1310
01:28:44,862 --> 01:28:46,197
All right, let's go.

1311
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,114
Okay.

1312
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:48,532
-Bye.
-Bye.

1313
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:50,034
Yeah, bye!

1314
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:53,245
Aren't you coming?

1315
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:54,580
I said okay!

1316
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:56,248
Will you hurry up?

1317
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:58,751
Hi, Sol-ji.
Sunday at Gwangalli Beach, right?

1318
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:02,296
I'm counting on all of you.
You guys are the best.

1319
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:03,589
Thank you so much.

1320
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:05,716
You heard her.

1321
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:09,637
This is the last project
of our school days.

1322
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:19,480
Aren't you cold?

1323
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:24,568
Sure, it's cold,
but we can't miss the stars.

1324
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:28,197
My sweet Hye-ri and Se-ri,

1325
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:30,616
I hope all your dreams come true,

1326
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:33,202
and you have happy lives.

1327
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:37,373
Wait.

1328
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:38,374
What about me?

1329
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:42,211
-Your dream's already come true.
-It has?

1330
01:29:42,962 --> 01:29:45,131
You married me.

1331
01:29:45,214 --> 01:29:46,882
You must be insane!

1332
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,968
-What?
-Unbelievable.

1333
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:52,805
You said that was your dream
when you asked me out.

1334
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,515
Zip it, old man.

1335
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:00,771
Hey! Speed it up!

1336
01:30:00,855 --> 01:30:01,856
Is this right?

1337
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:02,773
-This?
-No.

1338
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:06,152
-Stick it here?
-Yeah.

1339
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:09,321
It won't stand.

1340
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,867
-Ha-young.
-Yeah?

1341
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,118
Look. Is this okay?

1342
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:16,078
Yeah, looks good.

1343
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:23,836
Hey, they're coming!

1344
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,838
-What?
-Come on!

1345
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,090
Run!

1346
01:30:37,391 --> 01:30:38,267
You must be cold.

1347
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,226
What?

1348
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:41,228
No, I'm okay.

1349
01:30:47,026 --> 01:30:48,194
No!

1350
01:30:49,987 --> 01:30:51,447
-Go?
-Now?

1351
01:30:56,994 --> 01:30:58,829
I knew you'd need this.

1352
01:30:59,914 --> 01:31:01,624
Oh, thanks.

1353
01:31:04,585 --> 01:31:06,003
Do you want to go inside?

1354
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:06,962
Huh?

1355
01:31:07,046 --> 01:31:08,881
No, I'm fine.

1356
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:23,437
Not now. Go back inside.

1357
01:31:25,064 --> 01:31:26,649
Huh? To the right?

1358
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:27,983
-Right?
-Okay.

1359
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:28,901
That way.

1360
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:34,949
Wait, is that the cue? Should we hit play?

1361
01:31:38,077 --> 01:31:39,537
-Se-ri, just a moment.
-Huh?

1362
01:31:43,374 --> 01:31:46,669
Go back inside! Go inside!

1363
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:54,969
I need to use a phone.

1364
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:06,272
Just wait. Wait for my cue!

1365
01:32:08,274 --> 01:32:09,108
What?

1366
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:11,443
Wait!

1367
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,032
Hey.

1368
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:18,951
Are you okay?

1369
01:32:19,952 --> 01:32:21,412
Se-ri, I'm sorry.

1370
01:32:21,996 --> 01:32:23,956
I need to go to Seoul right now.

1371
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:26,750
My mom's in the hospital.

1372
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:34,717
SE-RI ♡ YUN-SEOK

1373
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:44,351
Se-ri.

1374
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,896
It's fine. We can do it again.

1375
01:32:49,607 --> 01:32:51,984
I'm so sorry. You all worked so hard.

1376
01:32:54,737 --> 01:32:56,196
Don't worry. We'll do it again.

1377
01:33:05,331 --> 01:33:07,082
Please leave a message.

1378
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:10,669
Yun-seok.

1379
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:14,131
I can't seem to reach you.

1380
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:17,968
Is your mom doing okay?

1381
01:33:19,136 --> 01:33:22,598
Leave me a voicemail
when you get the chance.

1382
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:25,100
I'll be waiting.

1383
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:51,585
I LIKE YOU TOO

1384
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,065
Have you gotten taller?

1385
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:20,114
It's been quite a while.

1386
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:22,241
Is that how you greet your father?

1387
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:26,870
She slipped on the stairs.

1388
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,165
You know how clumsy she can be.

1389
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,419
I heard you skipped the CSAT.

1390
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:39,466
She never cared about your studies.

1391
01:34:40,134 --> 01:34:41,885
And she calls herself a mother.

1392
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,893
So you did this to her?

1393
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:01,321
This is why I don't trust her.

1394
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:06,076
She said you're happier
and more cheerful down there,

1395
01:35:07,244 --> 01:35:09,079
but you've just become rude and dumb.

1396
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:20,841
Han Yun-seok.

1397
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,553
Get back home.

1398
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:37,274
FOR RENT

1399
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,696
Man, what happened to him?

1400
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,740
I wish he could just call us.

1401
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:48,243
My mom says the realtor received a call.

1402
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,413
Apparently, the paperwork's all done.

1403
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:55,250
But the call wasn't from Yun-seok's mom.

1404
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:57,252
What does that mean?

1405
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:01,089
Her husband's a professor
at Seongbuk University Hospital.

1406
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:03,717
He bullied his kid,
never happy with anything he did.

1407
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:05,427
I have to go.

1408
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:08,514
Se-ri!

1409
01:36:15,896 --> 01:36:17,064
Where are you going?

1410
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:18,565
Se-ri!

1411
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:26,365
This is Saemaeul Train No. 11,
bound for Seoul Station.

1412
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:42,840
SAEMAEUL TRAIN TICKET
BUSAN TO SEOUL

1413
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:50,556
Show your love through giving.

1414
01:36:53,225 --> 01:36:56,061
SEONGBUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

1415
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:03,861
Well…

1416
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:06,363
Excuse me.

1417
01:37:06,947 --> 01:37:09,825
Is there a patient
named Baek Jang-mi here?

1418
01:37:45,444 --> 01:37:49,656
BAEK JANG-MI

1419
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,581
Auntie called.

1420
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:05,839
She said to come to America now…

1421
01:38:08,342 --> 01:38:11,428
because once we return home,
he'll never let us leave again.

1422
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:18,268
We should go, right?

1423
01:38:33,325 --> 01:38:35,744
To be honest, I don't know what to do.

1424
01:38:42,459 --> 01:38:43,752
I don't want to go.

1425
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:04,940
Mom.

1426
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:07,776
I don't want to leave.

1427
01:39:11,989 --> 01:39:12,906
I just…

1428
01:39:16,118 --> 01:39:18,120
I just want to go back to Busan.

1429
01:39:46,023 --> 01:39:47,232
Hi.

1430
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:48,316
It's me.

1431
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,695
I can't get a hold of you.

1432
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:56,533
I have something to tell you.

1433
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:05,333
Yun-seok.

1434
01:40:08,962 --> 01:40:10,297
I miss you.

1435
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:13,967
I miss you so much.

1436
01:40:49,878 --> 01:40:51,671
Hi, it's me.

1437
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:54,591
I can't get a hold of you.

1438
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:57,928
I have something to tell you.

1439
01:41:01,598 --> 01:41:05,018
I thought about it while you were gone.

1440
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:10,232
I don't think I see you
as anything more than a friend.

1441
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:12,651
And

1442
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:17,197
if we keep spending time together,

1443
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,283
it'll probably lead to misunderstandings.

1444
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:25,288
It's better if we stop seeing each other.

1445
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:29,793
Don't call me anymore.

1446
01:41:58,572 --> 01:42:03,034
GARAM HIGH SCHOOL
GRADUATION CEREMONY

1447
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:11,126
Park Se-ri.

1448
01:42:12,002 --> 01:42:13,253
Se-ri.

1449
01:42:14,171 --> 01:42:16,965
Wow, I never thought I'd see this day.

1450
01:42:18,383 --> 01:42:20,343
-Well done.
-Thank you.

1451
01:42:23,889 --> 01:42:25,432
-Jang Yun-ho.
-Yes, sir.

1452
01:42:25,515 --> 01:42:28,018
Wow, S.E.S. You all look amazing.

1453
01:42:28,101 --> 01:42:30,145
-Right?
-Right.

1454
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:31,688
And quit smoking.

1455
01:42:35,734 --> 01:42:37,527
-Han Seong-min.
-Yes, sir.

1456
01:42:37,611 --> 01:42:40,322
PAK SE-RI AND HER CADDIE

1457
01:43:24,991 --> 01:43:27,202

THE WEIRDEST KIDS ON EARTH

1463
01:44:26,261 --> 01:44:29,180
CUTE. ARE YOU A BABY BIRD OR WHAT?

1464
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:33,143
SE-RI AS PAK SE-RI
HER FACE SAYS IT ALL

1465
01:44:38,648 --> 01:44:40,358
YOU FOUND ME!

1466
01:44:40,442 --> 01:44:43,528
I LIKE EVERY VERSION OF YOU, SE-RI

1467
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:52,495
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU LAUGH

1468
01:44:53,413 --> 01:44:56,166
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU MAKE ME LAUGH

1469
01:45:03,256 --> 01:45:05,383
I JUST LIKE YOU

1470
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:14,559
I'LL BE ROOTING FOR YOU ALWAYS

1471
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:21,900
Hi, Se-ri.

1472
01:45:24,778 --> 01:45:27,655
I'm writing down my feelings here

1473
01:45:27,739 --> 01:45:29,407
with pictures of things you like.

1474
01:45:30,116 --> 01:45:33,453
Your dad helped me with this,
and I hope he kept it a secret.

1475
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:45,048
Like you once said,

1476
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:49,260
I filled this with my heart
from all the times we shared,

1477
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:51,346
and that alone makes me happy.

1478
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:54,766
Se-ri,

1479
01:45:55,475 --> 01:45:59,396
you pulled me out of the water
and my dreams.

1480
01:45:59,979 --> 01:46:01,856
For that, I'm truly grateful.

1481
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:06,194
Your name,
which I held tightly in my hand…

1482
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:07,779
CHRONICLES OF LOVE

1483
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:10,490
…is now engraved in my heart
and can't be erased.

1484
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:14,869
I am so glad

1485
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:18,581
I met you on that windy day.

1486
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:33,680
I love you, Park Se-ri.

1487
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:14,053
Keep it straight!

1488
01:47:14,137 --> 01:47:15,472
Arms straight!

1489
01:47:15,555 --> 01:47:18,057
Keep your pace. Turn!

1490

MARINE SPORTS DEPARTMENT
PARK SE-RI

1491
01:47:38,578 --> 01:47:39,996
-Hey.
-Oh-my-Seri!

1492
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:41,915
Where are you? What's taking so long?

1493
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,876
Man, I can't get used to your voice.

1494
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:47,587
My class just ended. Stop bugging me.

1495
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,130
Fine. Just hurry up.

1496
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,466
Will you guys stop?

1497
01:47:51,549 --> 01:47:54,219
Hey, save that for when we're not around.

1498
01:47:54,302 --> 01:47:55,386
No.

1499
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:57,430
-Oh my God.
-You're so cute!

1500
01:47:58,431 --> 01:48:00,141
You're just so cute.

1501
01:48:00,225 --> 01:48:01,476
You're cute too.

1502
01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:04,395
Stop. My eyeballs are melting.

1503
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:05,855
Have a bite.

1504
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:07,190
Can I get a medium beer?

1505
01:48:07,273 --> 01:48:09,609
Hey, don't blow the blind date tomorrow.

1506
01:48:10,777 --> 01:48:12,195
I never said I'd do it.

1507
01:48:12,278 --> 01:48:13,655
Hey.

1508
01:48:14,447 --> 01:48:15,907
You won't come?

1509
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:19,869
But I already saved
the lucky table for you.

1510
01:48:19,953 --> 01:48:21,454
Lucky table?

1511
01:48:21,955 --> 01:48:24,499
That's where it all begins.

1512
01:48:25,083 --> 01:48:25,917
Sir.

1513
01:48:26,417 --> 01:48:29,379
I told you it's a secret.
You weren't supposed to tell!

1514
01:48:29,963 --> 01:48:30,797
You're right.

1515
01:48:31,297 --> 01:48:32,507
It's fine.

1516
01:48:33,091 --> 01:48:37,011
Confess your feelings there,
and it just works every time.

1517
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:38,096
I did too.

1518
01:48:39,264 --> 01:48:41,432
My darling's from Seoul,

1519
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:43,851
and we met right here.

1520
01:48:47,814 --> 01:48:48,940
Honey.

1521
01:48:49,857 --> 01:48:51,317
All right.

1522
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:52,527
I'll be right there.

1523
01:48:55,446 --> 01:48:56,739
Please come tomorrow.

1524
01:48:56,823 --> 01:48:58,741
You definitely have to now.

1525
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,121
There are couples everywhere.

1526
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:12,213
Oh-my-Seri, you better show up tomorrow!

1527
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:14,882
You have to, for me!

1528
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:31,024
Please come again.

1529
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:38,573
What are you thinking about?

1530
01:49:43,202 --> 01:49:44,245
Well,

1531
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:47,081
years ago, on that beach,

1532
01:49:47,582 --> 01:49:51,919
I planned the love confession of my life.

1533
01:49:52,879 --> 01:49:53,963
Did it work?

1534
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:58,676
I wouldn't be sitting here if it did.

1535
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:01,262
You never know who you'll meet in life.

1536
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:04,015
I never thought I'd live in Busan either.

1537
01:50:31,918 --> 01:50:38,383
SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY
I'M NOT FEELING WELL

1538
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:52,939
YOU LOOK FINE TO ME

1539
01:51:02,448 --> 01:51:04,659
Hello? What is this?

1540
01:51:06,744 --> 01:51:07,870
Hello?

1541
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:10,707
Where are you right now?

1542
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:12,417
-Hey!
-Mr. Kim Yeong-sik?

1543
01:51:13,084 --> 01:51:14,419
-Here!
-Hello?

1544
01:51:14,502 --> 01:51:15,336
Over here!

1545
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:21,300
Babe!

1546
01:51:35,064 --> 01:51:37,692
Seriously, are you messing with me?

1547
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:40,027
Se-ri.

1548
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,522
How have you been?

1549
01:52:25,615 --> 01:52:26,908
Yun-seok.

1550
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:30,203
I'm sorry.

1551
01:52:33,498 --> 01:52:36,834
I lied to you back then.

1552
01:52:38,002 --> 01:52:40,880
I actually missed you so much.

1553
01:52:42,298 --> 01:52:43,341
I know.

1554
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:44,967
You told me.

1555
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:48,304
I did?

1556
01:52:50,306 --> 01:52:51,641
You didn't know, did you?

1557
01:52:52,391 --> 01:52:54,477
The messages get saved,
even if you hang up.

1558
01:52:55,812 --> 01:52:56,813
Yun-seok.

1559
01:52:58,064 --> 01:52:59,440
I miss you.

1560
01:52:59,524 --> 01:53:02,235
I miss you so much.

1561
01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:16,541
I didn't want to delete your voice,

1562
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:19,043
so I've been paying my pager bill
all this time.

1563
01:53:27,969 --> 01:53:30,513
Here. I have something for you.

1564
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:43,651
I made one every time I thought of you,
and it became this.

1565
01:53:46,028 --> 01:53:47,947
Come on…

1566
01:53:50,658 --> 01:53:51,617
Se-ri.

1567
01:53:53,661 --> 01:53:54,579
Will you…

1568
01:53:56,789 --> 01:53:57,790
be my girlfriend?

1569
01:54:02,211 --> 01:54:03,087
Yeah.

1570
01:54:09,218 --> 01:54:11,220
Finally…

1571
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:32,658
Oh-my-Seri's got a boyfriend!

1572
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:40,791
I thought it was over long ago,

1573
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:45,087
but our final love confession
turned out to be a success.

1574
01:55:02,188 --> 01:55:03,022
Hey.

1575
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:04,899
Gimme.

1576
01:55:05,441 --> 01:55:06,317
Give me that.

1577
01:55:09,153 --> 01:55:10,321
Give it here.

1578
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:12,657
-Give me some too.
-Okay.

1579
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:13,741
Here.

1580
