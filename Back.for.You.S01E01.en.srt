1
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,480
Help!

2
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,760
Su Ruo

3
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,760
The body was only found at six
this morning.

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,800
This is an old neighborhood.

5
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,880
There aren't many cameras outside.

6
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,440
Every time you travel back in time,

7
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
the world you were in before

8
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,480
becomes

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,520
a parallel world you abandoned.

10
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,640
Su Ruo

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,840
Stay alive.

12
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,960
Sir,

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,240
you requested Chinese therapeutic massage.

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
It helps with circulation
and relieves fatigue.

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,360
You can close your eyes.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,520
My name is Yu Xingchen.

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm just an ordinary researcher.

18
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,080
After revising papers for three days straight,

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
I can finally relax for a bit.

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,280
Weihaoke's "That Year"

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,360
really captured the voice of youth.

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,200
I wonder if you ever sometimes

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
think of that person you liked.

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Sorry, are you hurt?

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
I was grading students' papers recently,

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,880
stayed up several nights.

27
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,760
That's really bad for your health.

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,920
Like when you saved up a week's homework,

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
and tried to finish it all overnight.

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
Who could handle that?

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,360
We had a classmate like that too.

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,400
He never did homework at night,

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
and copied it before morning class.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,760
I was like that too.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
What was that classmate's name?

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,160
I think it was

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,280
Yu Xingchen.

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Su Ruo

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,320
Yu Xingchen,

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,320
long time no see.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Her name is Su Ruo.

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,960
She was my classmate in high school.

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
She was outstanding in both character
and academics.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,600
Talented and beautiful.

45
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,840
She was the girl I never dared to pursue.

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Su Ruo

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,480
All these years,

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,160
you've been working here?

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,440
Yeah.

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,400
It's been many years.

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
Must be tough.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,360
Everything's tough these days.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,520
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
do you still like me?

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
Just asking casually.

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,720
Why are you so nervous?

57
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,720
My time's up.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
I can extend the session.

59
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,520
No need.

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,200
You can sleep a bit more.

61
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,320
You can close your eyes.

62
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,160
Close them.

63
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
Thanks for your hard work.

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm heading out.

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,200
Could you please

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,480
give this umbrella

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,200
to the guest in room 227?

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,760
Sure.

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Sir,

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,120
Therapist No. 12 asked me to tell you

71
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,440
she left after her shift.

72
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,040
Sir, here you go.

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,280
Thank you.

74
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,200
Confession.

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,720
One year after school, with everyone
egging me on,

76
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,920
I planned to confess to her.

77
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,000
Confession.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
But I lowered my head in front of her,

79
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,600
stammered for five minutes
without getting to the point.

80
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,320
Confession.

81
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,080
Until more and more people gathered around.

82
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,960
Do you have something to say to me?

83
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,040
There's no one here now.

84
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
You can say it.

85
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,080
I...

86
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
I want to tell you...

87
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,160
Are you trying to say you like me?

88
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,200
Okay, I get it.

89
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
You're a guy,

90
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,760
if you like someone in the future,

91
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,360
just say it.

92
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll go now.

93
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,640
To her,

94
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,920
I was just one of many boys
who liked her.

95
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,880
Her "I get it"

96
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
was a polite and friendly rejection.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
So after graduation,

98
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
my timid self never contacted her again.

99
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,400
Who would've thought, after fifteen years,

100
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,000
we'd meet again like this.

101
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,920
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

102
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,920
do you still like me?

103
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I do.

104
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
Yes, I do.

105
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,560
Of course I do.

106
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,280
I do.

107
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,040
It's me.

108
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,400
I had a meeting last night,

109
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,680
so I missed your call.

110
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,560
Is something up?

111
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,640
I went to bed early yesterday.

112
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,520
I saw your call and called you back.

113
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,360
Hello, the number you dialed
is powered off.

114
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,240
Old classmate,

115
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,080
you're here so early to see me.

116
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,120
Do you remember?

117
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
The deceased was our high school classmate.

118
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,640
The one you've never forgotten.

119
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,760
Su Ruo.

120
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,040
Her body was only found at six this morning.

121
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,680
Cause of death: falling from a building.

122
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,920
Yu Xingchen, long time no see.

123
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,920
You...

124
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
were her last client.

125
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,240
No one saw her after she left work yesterday.

126
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
You've been working here all these years.

127
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,480
It's been quite a few years.

128
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,360
Must be tough, right?

129
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
Everything's tough nowadays.

130
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,800
Let me treat you to a late-night snack.

131
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,560
Maybe another day.

132
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll ask you out next time.

133
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
The surveillance matches what he said.

134
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,880
No obvious signs of struggle or injury.

135
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
Her belongings and wallet weren't missing.

136
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,440
Forensics Division found this at her place.

137
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
Did you give this to her?

138
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
Is this letter from you?

139
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,280
We hadn't met for fifteen years before last night.

140
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,840
You used cut-out letters to hide your handwriting.

141
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
It wasn't me.

142
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,520
Check the fingerprints if you don't believe me.

143
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,200
This letter was written with gloves on.

144
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,240
No fingerprints could be found on the letter.

145
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,560
It really wasn't me.

146
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,720
If you don't believe me, lock me up and interrogate me.

147
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,800
I don't even know her address.

148
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
How could I mail her this letter?

149
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,920
We believe it was just an accident.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,240
But as police officers,

151
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,600
it's our duty to ask you for clarification.

152
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
After all, you were the last person she saw.

153
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,560
She...

154
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,920
How did she really die?

155
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,320
We're still investigating.

156
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I want to see where it happened.

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,680
Bro, I understand you.

158
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
It's hard when an old classmate has an accident.

159
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
I was the one who reported it.

160
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,800
I also led the police into the apartment.

161
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,400
If you have questions, just ask me.

162
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,080
Did the deceased live in this building?

163
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,200
No, she lived in the building opposite.

164
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,480
This is an old neighborhood.

165
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,880
There aren't many cameras outside.

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Only the area downstairs has surveillance.

167
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Were you on duty the day it happened?

168
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
No, it was another guy.

169
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,160
I heard that on the day of the incident,

170
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
the rooftop door was locked from inside.

171
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
The girl probably locked it herself.

172
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
She fell from right here.

173
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
You shouldn't stay here too long.

174
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm heading down now.

175
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,920
Just yesterday,

176
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,480
Su Ruo gently

177
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,800
said so many things to me.

178
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,400
In just half a day,

179
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,200
she's gone somewhere I can't reach.

180
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
Was she ever afraid?

181
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,840
When she called me,

182
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,480
what was she thinking?

183
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,240
Everyone says you like me.

184
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,680
By the way, Yu Xingchen,

185
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,040
do you still like me?

186
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,160
Do you still like me?

187
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,680
I do.

188
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,720
At first,

189
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,000
I thought this was just a dream.

190
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm dreaming.
