1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,961
NO TAIL TO TELL

2
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,580
Get off me.

3
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,498
Sorry.

4
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,923
Are you…

5
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,717
okay?

6
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,344
Do I look okay to you right now?

7
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,638
-Of course I'm not okay.
-I see.

8
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,310
By the way…

9
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:48,108
you just saw
that strange thing too, right?

10
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,448
It's not strange. It's mystical.

11
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,077
Anyway, it looks like I have
more urgent matters to attend to.

12
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,704
What?

13
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,290
I'll deal with you later.

14
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,254
What are you doing?

15
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,923
Damn it.

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,509
Just how much spiritual power did I lose?

17
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,803
I can't even do this all of a sudden?

18
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,390
Darn it.

19
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,188
What's with her? Is she an actual lunatic?

20
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,485
But why did you come to see me…

21
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,113
WARD 22
NURSING STATION

22
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,533
Where did she go?

23
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,208
STORAGE ROOM

24
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,799
Are you kidding me?

25
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,130
We need to talk.

26
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,854
I said, we need to talk.

27
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,338
I told you.

28
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,592
I'm not that naive fox I used to be.

29
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,516
All this wood will burn nicely.

30
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,276
You're still wicked and irreverent.

31
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,905
What do you think you're doing?

32
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,366
I don't expect you to honor the deities,

33
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,243
but you should at least be reasonable.

34
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,163
I just lost a huge chunk
of my spiritual power.

35
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,289
Out of the blue.

36
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,042
But no matter how much
I think about it, I just don't get it.

37
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,927
You've made quite a mess.

38
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,273
Was it this iron rod
that smashed the statues,

39
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,150
or was it you?

40
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,194
What are you talking about?

41
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,697
I didn't come all this way
to listen to your cryptic nonsense.

42
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,616
Just tell me why!

43
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,956
I've already given you the answer.

44
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,335
You're just being stubborn
instead of seeking the truth yourself.

45
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,797
I'm done cultivating myself,
so go ahead and do it as much as you want.

46
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,925
-Tell me why!
-You've sinned,

47
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,845
so you've paid the price.

48
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,305
Don't be ridiculous.

49
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,933
How is this an appropriate price?

50
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,228
I said I lost a huge chunk
of my spiritual power.

51
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,480
What did I do that was so wrong?

52
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,526
A human has died.

53
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,528
Because of you.

54
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,408
What?

55
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,451
What are you talking about?

56
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,788
Because you twisted human fate recklessly,

57
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,959
someone who wasn't
supposed to die has died.

58
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,442
EPISODE 2
THE HOUR OF TRANSFER

59
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,401
TRANSFER

60
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,944
1. A BIZARRE EVENT THAT DEFIES REASON

61
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,572
2. AN ATHLETE MOVING
FROM ONE TEAM TO ANOTHER

62
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:51,077
URI GARAM HOSPITAL

63
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,291
The next bus to arrive is number 360.

64
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,753
Hi.

65
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,175
You…

66
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,219
You know,
I think you'll need to make a wish.

67
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,639
What?

68
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,856
Hey, wait. Please stop!

69
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,109
Oh no! That was the last bus.

70
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,821
-Did you even hear what I said?
-Just a second.

71
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,826
Man, that really was the last bus.
I don't even have money for a cab.

72
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,537
-Hey.
-Seriously, hold on a second.

73
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,248
HOME
FASTEST ROUTE: 4H 24M

74
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,626
It takes over four hours
to walk home, jeez.

75
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,294
Hey.

76
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,466
Where do you live?

77
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,052
If I take you home,
will you actually listen to me?

78
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:50,887
What?

79
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,308
Have you heard of earth-folding?
It's similar to teleporting.

80
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,354
Like in martial arts novels?

81
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,480
Yeah, that.

82
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,941
I'm telling you now
so you don't freak out.

83
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,946
Let's go.

84
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,704
What the heck was that?

85
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,831
We're in front of my house.

86
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,666
I told you it was earth-folding.

87
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,209
I used sorcery to fold the earth.

88
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,087
Fold… the earth?

89
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,300
Wait, could you even travel
to Europe like this?

90
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,428
Like to Germany and Spain?

91
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,557
I guess not,
since they're across the ocean.

92
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,309
Of course I can!

93
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,227
That's not even an issue.

94
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,273
Back in the day,
I'd wake up and go to New York for bagels,

95
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,317
then go to France for lunch.

96
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,277
I was a regular
at a restaurant over there.

97
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,988
And after that,
I'd have my coffee in Italy.

98
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,701
But after a year or two,
you get sick of it.

99
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,661
That's insane.

100
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,416
You know…

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,460
that thing you just did.

102
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,754
Could you do it one more time?

103
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,967
Do I just need to hold
your hand like this?

104
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,193
What… are you doing?

105
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,403
Oh, I…

106
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,907
I'm sorry, I just found it fascinating.

107
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,701
Well…

108
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,204
I only showed you this

109
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,125
to make up
for embarrassing myself earlier.

110
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,084
Okay.

111
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,131
Anyway, that's not the point.

112
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,177
You're going to help me.

113
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,223
It's nothing big. Just make a simple wish.

114
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,559
A wish?

115
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,980
Yeah. I can't just interfere
in human affairs without a human's wish.

116
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,940
So you have to make a wish for me.

117
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:57,073
You want to catch that hit-and-run driver
and make him pay, right?

118
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,201
Hey!

119
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,287
Stop!

120
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,330
I said stop!

121
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,877
Wish for it.

122
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,129
I'll grant it for you.

123
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,856
No smoking in here.

124
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,237
We could've done
this witness interview over the phone.

125
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,489
Why drag someone so busy
all the way here?

126
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,492
Oh, this isn't a witness interview.

127
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,787
Mr. Lee has just been named a suspect.

128
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,456
Wait,

129
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,167
the real culprit for that hit-and-run
has already turned himself in--

130
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,085
Well, the security footage…

131
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,131
suddenly got restored last night.

132
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,218
Strangely, all the cameras
in that area malfunctioned,

133
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,136
so we hadn't been able
to confirm anything.

134
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,222
Isn't that fortunate?

135
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,772
Damn.

136
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,732
Damn it.

137
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,570
Okay.

138
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,958
What the…

139
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,712
Why aren't you showing up? Are you hiding?

140
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,856
Damn it.

141
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,193
What's she doing?

142
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,863
After messing up a job like this,

143
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,657
why aren't you showing up?

144
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,658
Why?

145
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,577
Disgusting. Shit.

146
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,039
…SERVING THE PEOPLE, GOWON POLICE

147
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,500
He's here! He's out!

148
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,712
Is it true that you caused a hit-and-run
and had someone else take the fall?

149
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,714
Any thoughts on the added DUI allegations?

150
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,009
Do you think this will affect
your inheritance of the Geumsu Group?

151
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,510
Just a word, please!

152
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,679
Just a quick word on how you're feeling?

153
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,309
-Please give us a statement!
-Just one statement!

154
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,604
It's really nothing, Father.

155
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,982
I'm telling you, I can handle this.

156
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,443
Father… Father!

157
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,198
Damn it, that senile old geezer.

158
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,659
Shit.

159
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,998
Did you take care of things last night?

160
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,001
I took care of it
so it wouldn't cause any issues.

161
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,378
There's no way

162
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,631
-that they'll suddenly find Bong-chang.
-Good.

163
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,385
If that blows up too,
I won't be able to handle it.

164
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:05,970
Yes, sir.

165
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,224
Of all the damn luck…

166
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,150
What's happening?

167
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,361
What's… wrong with this thing?

168
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,448
In other news,

169
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,911
a body was found earlier today
in the mountains near Gyeonggi Province.

170
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,747
The victim has been identified as Mr. Ko,

171
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,832
-a chauffeur for a construction company.
-Hey!

172
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,876
-Police are investigating…
-Is that…

173
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,587
-…treating it as a homicide.
-That's impossible.

174
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,798
Hey! What are you doing?

175
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,843
-I didn't do this. I swear!
-What the hell are you saying?

176
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,053
It was me.

177
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,554
You.

178
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,015
You kept summoning me earlier.

179
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,101
Too bad for you.

180
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,228
You can't be my client anymore.

181
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,523
Don't tell me you did all this?

182
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,986
Hey…

183
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,240
Pull over, you bastard.

184
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,867
I told you I'd pay you.

185
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,247
-So why are you doing this to me?
-I don't want to be doing this either.

186
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,248
But…

187
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,960
have you ever heard
of the butterfly effect?

188
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,129
Everyone on the left side…

189
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,547
I helped you.

190
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,926
And that night, you got carried away
and drove home completely wasted.

191
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,928
Then you caused an accident.

192
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,472
And while trying to cover it up…

193
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,477
-How dare you…
-…you ended up killing someone.

194
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,148
I don't really get it either,

195
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,900
but this is
what the ones above are saying.

196
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:43,943
I helped you.

197
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,029
And because of that, someone who wasn't
supposed to die is dead.

198
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,114
What?

199
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,659
Don't bother trying to understand.
I don't get it either.

200
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,163
Anyway, one has to clean up
their own messes, right?

201
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,874
Since I started this,
I'm going to sort it out myself.

202
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,793
And that'll help me recover
some of my lost spiritual power.

203
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,420
That was just a mistake.

204
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,423
No, it was an accident.

205
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,675
From now on, you won't be able to lie.

206
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,976
And you won't be able
to hide anything anymore.

207
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,520
Every single wrong you've ever committed,

208
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,858
even that pen you stole
from the stationery store as a kid,

209
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,235
you're going to confess to it all.

210
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,863
Oh, right.

211
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,825
I'll be taking this

212
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,286
since you're no longer my client.

213
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,354
Is he trying to say something?

214
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,815
I want to turn myself in.

215
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,401
What? Turn himself in?

216
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,154
Are you confessing
to the hit-and-run incident?

217
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,615
It's alleged
that you attempted to switch drivers.

218
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,368
Is there a reason
why you decided to turn yourself in?

219
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,036
I…

220
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,708
killed

221
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,627
someone!

222
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,796
-Oh my God!
-What?

223
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,008
I can't do this.

224
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,679
You bastard.

225
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,020
The victim died on the spot.

226
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,898
And to cover up the crime,

227
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,777
I ordered the body
to be buried in the mountains.

228
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,861
-Come quickly.
-Yes, sir!

229
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,155
All this time,

230
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,782
I've been building slush funds

231
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,368
-worth tens of billions of won…
-Hey, wait a minute!

232
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,580
…through offshore tax evasion
using overseas subsidiaries!

233
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,040
-Just a second!
-Was it intentional?

234
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,543
FAIRNESS UNDER THE LAW
SERVING THE PEOPLE, GOWON POLICE

235
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,260
This is a gift.

236
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,351
What is this?

237
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,104
It's a suitcase.
You'll probably need it soon.

238
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,232
I'm sure you saw the news.
It all worked out thanks to you.

239
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,902
I've even recovered
some of my spiritual power.

240
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,111
Gosh…

241
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,906
Was that really all you?

242
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,158
Wow.

243
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,952
You know, I've been wondering.

244
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,998
Who exactly… are you?

245
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,126
You want to know my name?

246
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,004
Well, that's too bad.

247
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,715
I don't usually tell humans my name.

248
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,342
No. That's not what I meant.

249
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,887
I mean, what are you exactly?
Not your name, but what you are.

250
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,847
Oh, that.

251
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,267
Take a guess.

252
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,770
Well, I'm not sure.

253
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,940
A demon?

254
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,149
What?

255
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,359
-Satan?
-What?

256
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,861
No?

257
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,657
Try again. Think of something more Korean.

258
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,372
Well…

259
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,922
-A maiden ghost?
-A nine-tailed fox!

260
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,341
Can't you tell just by looking at me?
This beauty.

261
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,094
And this mystique.

262
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,180
A nine-tailed fox?

263
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,349
Like an actual fox with nine tails…

264
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,309
Wait!

265
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,938
So I wasn't just seeing things back then.

266
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,359
Yes, just like in Return of the Legend,
except I have no interest in livers.

267
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,446
And I definitely have no interest
in becoming human.

268
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,114
Wow.

269
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,324
Anyway, that's not why I'm here this time.

270
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,704
Take this. You'll need it sooner or later.

271
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,458
What now…

272
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,500
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

273
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,335
Nine-tailed foxes do
this sort of thing too?

274
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,879
Times have changed.

275
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,298
Think of it as a business model.

276
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,633
You're going to be quite wealthy soon.

277
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,844
Wealthy enough to be my client.

278
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,555
Seriously…

279
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,057
Are you messing with me right now?

280
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,559
What?

281
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,852
I mean,

282
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,397
last time, you called me a nobody
and told me not to dream big.

283
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,484
You said all those mean things
about my future.

284
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,610
What changed?

285
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,238
Oh, that?

286
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,118
I guess I misread things at first.

287
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,958
Fate doesn't just change like that.

288
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,419
Whatever, it's fine.

289
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,755
I didn't care about what you said anyway.

290
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,590
I told you.

291
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,510
In a few years,
I'm going to be a really famous athlete.

292
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,805
What I'm talking about

293
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,224
is nothing like
your childish wishful thinking.

294
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,976
I'm telling you
what I saw in your actual future.

295
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,356
Whoa, it's hot! What was that?

296
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,107
I had to show you how to use it.

297
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,193
I'll appear whenever you burn that.

298
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,488
Why couldn't you just say so
instead of scaring me like that?

299
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,157
-Give it back.
-I already did.

300
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,283
But it's gone.

301
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,370
Well, I'll be away for a while
for personal reasons.

302
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,955
And more importantly,

303
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,292
it'd be annoying
if someone who's broke kept summoning me.

304
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,087
So it'll appear naturally
when the time is right.

305
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,591
You can go now. We're done.

306
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,346
Seriously though…

307
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,139
Are you really

308
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,767
not going to tell me your name?

309
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,062
What?

310
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,902
Eun-ho.

311
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,655
My name is Eun-ho.

312
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,163
You should feel honored.
I don't tell just anyone.

313
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,000
I see.

314
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,711
Eun-ho.

315
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,513
Kang Si-yeol?

316
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,436
You must be tired.

317
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,315
I'm Hong Yeon-su,
Team Leader at the Soccer Association.

318
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,274
Remember me?

319
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,068
Oh, right.

320
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,906
It's nice to see you.

321
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,455
Did you already hear the news?

322
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,415
Pardon?

323
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,628
You've been selected
for the youth national team.

324
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,840
Me? On the national team?

325
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,258
Do you have a passport?

326
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,469
You have to leave next week
for overseas training.

327
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,137
Wait a second.

328
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,348
Why am I all of a sudden…

329
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,559
I guess you haven't heard the news yet.

330
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,605
You're a replacement for Hyeon Woo-seok.

331
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,982
As you know, Hyeon Woo-seok is injured,

332
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,818
so there's no clear starter
for that position right now.

333
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,696
I see.

334
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,365
Be prepared. I'll see you then.

335
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,491
You realize

336
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,578
this is a big opportunity for you, right?

337
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,566
-Are you okay?
-Of course.

338
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,821
My face is everything to me,
and I'm scar-free and still handsome.

339
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,407
Whatever.

340
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,369
How long will rehab take?

341
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,415
I don't know. Maybe about a year.

342
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,712
Hey, whatever you do, don't get injured.

343
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,589
This rehab stuff is brutal.

344
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:10,718
After rehab,

345
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,054
you'll still be able to play, right?

346
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,681
Of course.

347
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,518
What else would I do besides soccer?

348
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:24,940
Don't worry about me.
Just go and do your best, you punk.

349
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,776
Finish your rehab
and get back as soon as you can.

350
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,112
A year on your ass in rehab?
Total overkill.

351
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,447
"My ass"?

352
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,700
Fine. I'll be back in exactly six months.

353
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,536
Until then,

354
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,165
keep my spot warm
till I'm back, all right?

355
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,834
Whatever, man.

356
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,004
Hey, I came up with a new move.

357
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,092
Since I'm right-footed,
it doesn't matter if my left gets injured.

358
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,011
So, if I do it like this…

359
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,512
Yeah, real good.

360
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,728
Kang Si-yeol?

361
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,231
Hello.

362
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,337
NINE YEARS LATER

363
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,268
What do you think?

364
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,273
It's nice. I like it.

365
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,525
Right?

366
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,654
Islands like this
rarely come on the market.

367
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,197
And it can also be developed.

368
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,991
So, if you build a few villas over there

369
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,993
and bring in tourists--

370
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,080
No need.
I'll be the only one using this island.

371
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,248
Pardon?

372
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,709
I'm going to turn this whole island
into my private retreat.

373
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,503
I see.

374
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,256
But if you're the only one
using such a large island,

375
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,591
how do you plan
on traveling back and forth?

376
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,469
If a typhoon hits,
you'll be stranded all by yourself.

377
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,222
I won't be traveling by boat,
so you don't need to worry.

378
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,683
Anyway, how much was it again?

379
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,102
Right. It's 12 billion won.

380
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,689
It is a high-end property,

381
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,359
but with a bit of negotiation,
we could maybe get it down to 11 billion.

382
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,903
Forget it. It's just a billion won.

383
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,739
What's the point of haggling
over pocket change?

384
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,618
Go check. The money should be in.

385
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,079
Okay, sure.

386
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,838
Excuse me.

387
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,924
Not a single won has come in.

388
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,719
What?

389
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,512
Hold on.

390
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,599
Does that mean
I don't even have 12 billion won left?

391
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,517
Just because I took a few years off?

392
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,145
What would you like to do?

393
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,191
Give me time. I know I can get the money.

394
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,445
But…

395
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,782
can't you make it
a clean 10 billion instead of 11?

396
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,391
Premier League star Kang Si-yeol

397
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,145
signed a massive contract extension
with Thames FC today.

398
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,480
Thames FC announced through their website

399
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:24,317
that they successfully
re-signed Kang Si-yeol.

400
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,903
They expressed great joy and gratitude

401
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,531
for being able to continue

402
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,826
their journey with their team leader
and franchise star.

403
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,495
Kang Si-yeol's new contract
will last for five years,

404
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,623
making him one
of the highest-paid players in the league.

405
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,001
Becoming the first Asian player

406
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,920
to lead the league
in both goals and assists,

407
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,548
Kang Si-yeol achieved
a career high last season.

408
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:51,845
This sparked speculation
and media reports about his next transfer.

409
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,972
Amid the growing interest,

410
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:58,268
international media outlets rushed
to report on his contract renewal.

411
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,522
Officials from several clubs
that had pursued Kang Si-yeol

412
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:06,318
have expressed their disappointment
following the news.

413
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,362
As Kang Si-yeol has emerged
as a global sports star

414
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,739
beyond South Korea,

415
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:16,495
soccer fans around the world
are eagerly awaiting his next move.

416
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:35,514
NICHOLAS: HEART OF VICTORY

417
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,038
Do you know what time it is?
Why are you still in bed?

418
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,338
It's time you started living
like a normal person!

419
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,216
Seriously, it's just soccer.

420
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,469
Just because you quit
doesn't mean your life is over.

421
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,015
Don't try to stop me.
I'm throwing all this out today.

422
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,150
OUR ETERNAL LEGEND
COACH CHA BUM-KUN

423
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,862
This is the Cha Bum-kun Soccer Award.
Why would you throw it away, you crazy…

424
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,120
There's more inside.

425
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:59,139
HYEON WOO-SEOK

426
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,775
You don't…

427
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,195
have to throw all of them away.

428
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,433
I'm sorry.

429
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:48,647
About what?

430
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,610
For not succeeding like Si-yeol.

431
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,242
You never know how life will turn out.

432
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,829
You were better than Si-yeol
when you were younger.

433
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,709
For now,

434
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,295
he might be on top.

435
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,924
But you never know
what could happen in 10 or 20 years.

436
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,637
It all depends
on how you live from now on.

437
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,791
Is it…

438
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,711
raining outside?

439
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,302
I guess

440
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,096
we still need more time.

441
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,683
You and I both.

442
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,777
KANG SI-YEOL'S TOP PICK

443
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,488
Welcome.

444
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,205
KANG SI-YEOL'S CHOCOLATE BAR OF CHOICE

445
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,256
He's basically raking in money.

446
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,012
Oh my gosh!
I finally found the Kang Si-yeol bun.

447
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,806
-Which sticker's inside? Check.
-Inside?

448
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,057
I can't really see it.

449
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,183
Hey.

450
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,643
Yes?

451
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,479
I grabbed it first.

452
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,773
I had to hit five convenience stores
just to find it.

453
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,274
No, that's not it.

454
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,777
Do you guys know a lot about Kang Si-yeol?

455
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,905
LIMITED EDITION BUN

456
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,079
What is all this?

457
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,915
It's all Si-yeol's merch. So cute, right?

458
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:59,045
This is a fan club item
made to celebrate Si-yeol's Golden Boot.

459
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,630
-And this--
-Enough of that!

460
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,633
There's only one thing I'm curious about.

461
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,094
Kang Si-yeol.

462
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,596
How much does he really make?

463
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,765
Didn't you see the recent articles?

464
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,309
Apparently,
he makes 500 million won a week.

465
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,812
And he's in tons of commercials.

466
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,231
I heard he gets paid
over a billion won for each one.

467
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,315
Really?

468
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:25,738
Then that means he's finally
successful enough to be my client.

469
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,001
What the heck is this?

470
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,716
I AM KANG SI-YEOL
WRITTEN BY KANG SI-YEOL

471
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,801
An autobiography?

472
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,768
How many times
are you going to read that?

473
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:56,811
What?

474
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,439
It's a good book.

475
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,484
I've never read a book

476
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,987
that resonated with me
quite like this one.

477
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,783
That's because
it's the only book you've ever read.

478
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,535
I AM KANG SI-YEOL

479
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,623
That's because everything is in here.

480
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,291
The hardships of my youth.

481
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:22,879
My constant effort, discipline,
and patience to overcome those hardships.

482
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,214
Only to be met by inevitable despair.

483
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,302
Despite the endless
resentment and jealousy,

484
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,013
I rose above every limit to achieve

485
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,765
dazzling success.

486
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,352
All of that fits in a single book?

487
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,648
Yeon-su, do you know
what the theme of this book really is?

488
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,899
"I'm the best."

489
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,906
"There may be arrogance,
but never complacency."

490
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,536
I'm so proud that I am me.

491
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,999
Yeah, and I'm also proud of myself

492
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,835
for being your agent all this time.

493
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,088
I really am handsome.

494
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,841
Put it down already.

495
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,806
KANG SI-YEOL IS KILLING IT ON THE FIELD!

496
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,766
-Kang Si-yeol!
-Kang Si-yeol!

497
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,105
HOLD YOUR BREATH
AND FALL FOR SI-YEOL

498
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,773
-Wow, he's signing!
-Please sign mine too!

499
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,274
KANG SI-YEOL IS SEXY…

500
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,740
Thank you.

501
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,286
Long time no see, Si-yeol.

502
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,670
Excuse me…

503
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,965
Where would you like me to sign?

504
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,510
What?

505
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,678
Oh, for crying out loud.

506
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,895
Thank you.

507
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:24,959
Wait…

508
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,088
Did he seriously not recognize me?

509
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,486
Excuse me, your suitcase is open!

510
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:06,876
Excuse me, what are you doing--

511
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,837
Since you went ahead
and signed my back without asking,

512
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,255
I'm returning the favor.

513
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,144
What's with that woman?

514
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,608
INCHEON AIRPORT GOES WILD FOR KANG SI-YEOL

515
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,655
DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC OPEN TRYOUTS

516
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,864
Keep running!

517
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,495
Hey, Woo-seok.

518
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,331
Hello, Coach.

519
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,624
Yeah, hi.

520
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,876
What are you doing here?

521
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,629
Well…

522
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,470
Wait, you're not here
for the tryouts, are you?

523
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,226
WOW, DAEHEUNG CITIZENS SOCCER CLUB
LET'S MAKE HISTORY!

524
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,395
-Here, Woo-seok.
-Thank you.

525
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,856
You need to stir it.

526
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,698
Woo-seok, why are you doing this?

527
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,326
You were cut from this team
not too long ago.

528
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,080
And you're back for an open tryout?
You really think that's going to work?

529
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,876
Please just give me a fair chance, Coach.

530
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,295
I've still got it.

531
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,589
I took a few months off
and got my head straight--

532
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,924
Do you think I don't know
how good you are?

533
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,718
I coached you for years.

534
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,096
This is the K4 League, kid.
It's the fourth division.

535
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,473
Didn't you see how young those kids are?

536
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,435
And you? How old are you now?

537
00:44:55,276 --> 00:45:00,156
Hey, the club says they won't
even offer you a paid contract

538
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,575
because you'd be too expensive.

539
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,829
More than anything,
playing here for a few more years

540
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,664
won't change a thing for you.

541
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,627
Shouldn't you look for something else
while you're still young?

542
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:19,258
What, you think training here a bit more
is going to get you into the K League?

543
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,676
Or even the national team?

544
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:29,143
COACH'S OFFICE

545
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,823
I'm in Korea right now.

546
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,701
If you're free later,
do you want to meet at our usual spot?

547
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,370
SI-YEOL

548
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,121
What are you doing? Busy?

549
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,340
Yeah.

550
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,677
What am I doing?

551
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,196
SI-YEOL

552
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,907
Hey, I'm still waiting.

553
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,294
Seriously, he should at least reply.

554
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:54,937
DELIVERY KING

555
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,856
As you requested,

556
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,483
we've designed it based on
a private theme park concept.

557
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,153
But if we do this,
the costs will skyrocket--

558
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,739
Don't worry about the money.

559
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,574
A huge sum is coming my way soon.

560
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,659
Hold on. Stop there.

561
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,620
Are those the only
dining chairs they have?

562
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:16,584
I need a luxurious chair,
worthy of a high-end mansion…

563
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,046
Maybe I should make one.

564
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,886
You signed up
for the workshop today, right?

565
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,556
Yeah, I did.
I've done a lot of things in my time.

566
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,143
But I've never tried woodworking,
so I wanted to give it a go.

567
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,062
Oh, I see.

568
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,773
Since it's your first time,

569
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,734
how about a cutting board or a trivet?

570
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,569
A trivet? Please.

571
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,571
I'm going to make a chair.

572
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,950
Not a boring chair like that one.

573
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,536
A chair that perfectly fits
the curves of my body

574
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,957
and wraps me in comfort
while looking elegant and refined.

575
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,834
A chair that's like a work of art.

576
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,297
It's not as easy as it looks.

577
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,716
It's not as easy as it looks.

578
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,095
So, use holds of the same color,
and at the top--

579
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,721
But that is too easy.

580
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,101
I'm going to climb that one.

581
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,397
-Wow.
-She's fearless.

582
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,193
This is way too easy.

583
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,571
What's so fun about this?

584
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,117
Look at her go.
She doesn't seem scared at all.

585
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,957
-What was that?
-She practically flew!

586
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,000
-How is that possible?
-She flew!

587
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:47,758
You're going to do what?

588
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,844
I'm thinking of putting together
an idol group.

589
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,804
K-pop is all the rage these days.

590
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,067
Gosh, you created the group FOX9?

591
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:10,156
It's not "FOX9." It's F.O.X.9!

592
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,116
Don't be so out of touch.

593
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,037
Anyway, hitting number one once
really went to their heads.

594
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,456
So I quit that too.

595
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,211
Anyway, I'm all set.

596
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,547
So, what do I do now?

597
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,765
Shall we try again from the beginning?

598
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,023
I did it!

599
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:48,110
My gosh, I think I have a talent
for woodworking too.

600
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,778
Well, now that you've finished one leg,

601
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:52,364
shall we try making the other three?

602
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,952
You want me to do more sawing?

603
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:00,831
Excuse me.

604
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,571
The chair's almost finished,

605
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,782
and he still hasn't summoned me?

606
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,993
I even made sure
the business card appeared.

607
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:50,422
START

608
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,108
Man, it's freezing.

609
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,740
My muscles are recovering.

610
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,910
-What's that?
-Jeez!

611
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,537
Gosh, that's cold!

612
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,374
You again.

613
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,505
Who are you?

614
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,674
How did you get in here?

615
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,845
Why don't you come out?
I'm here on business.

616
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,222
No, I can't exactly come out right now…

617
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,685
Wait, you can't just barge
into someone's house.

618
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,395
Are you one of my fans?

619
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,732
Even if you are, this is still a crime.

620
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,442
Then report me.

621
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,111
-What?
-I said, go ahead and report me.

622
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:02,870
Look…

623
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,080
I won't report you.

624
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,791
So could you just toss me
that towel over there?

625
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,209
I need it to get out.

626
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,794
No.

627
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,006
On second thought, this is fine.
So you can just listen from there.

628
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,634
Come on. Just toss it to me!

629
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:17,843
Hey, you.

630
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,887
Do you really not remember me?

631
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,848
How should I know who you are?

632
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:26,769
Wait a minute.

633
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:31,315
Actually, you do look a bit familiar.

634
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,613
Hey!

635
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:44,328
Do you remember me now?
Long time no see, Si-yeol.

636
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,002
Congratulations. Today is the day.

637
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,922
The day you've been waiting
and hoping for.

638
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,840
Pardon?

639
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,010
You've become quite wealthy.

640
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,053
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

641
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,889
Which means you're finally eligible
to be one of my clients.

642
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,932
Tell me. Whatever it is.

643
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,141
What's your wish?

644
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,603
-Well--
-Wait.

645
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,523
For the record, you should
choose your wish very carefully.

646
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,109
Because my fee
is going to be extremely high.

647
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,617
But I don't have one.

648
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,745
-What?
-I don't have any wishes.

649
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:36,880
I don't think
you quite understand the situation.

650
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,674
This is an incredible opportunity.

651
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:42,177
Any human would be dying
to ask me for a wish.

652
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:46,140
I like my life the way it is.
There's nothing I want to change.

653
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,811
Didn't you miss out
on that undefeated title or whatever?

654
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,354
I can make that happen for you.

655
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:58,068
What's the point of that?
What matters is doing it myself.

656
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,780
Really? That's unexpected.
I didn't take you for that type.

657
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,241
But I can do much more than just that.

658
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,660
For example…

659
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:10,038
I can change your body
to what it was when you were 20.

660
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,377
Perhaps you didn't get
a good look at me earlier.

661
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,424
I had a checkup recently,
and my biological age is 21.

662
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,968
What about your parents?

663
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,678
Are they suffering from any illnesses?

664
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,474
Once humans reach that age,
something inevitably starts to break down.

665
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:29,850
I can heal them for you.

666
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,561
I was raised by my grandmother.

667
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,147
My parents passed away when I was young.

668
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,440
Your grandmother, then!

669
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,859
Aren't you worried about her health?

670
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,361
She passed away a few years ago.

671
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,783
Well, that's quite… unfortunate.

672
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,579
Anyway, think about it.

673
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,290
You might not want anything right now,

674
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,167
but life is long.

675
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,711
You may not know it,

676
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:00,130
but human life is very fragile.

677
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,967
It can be shattered so easily
by even the smallest of things.

678
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:06,887
When that happens…

679
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,765
you'll be needing my help.

680
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,280
She's still the same.

681
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,408
She comes and goes as she pleases.

682
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,411
Back when my life was whole,

683
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,372
and everything was in its place…

684
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,085
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

685
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,672
Woo-seok.

686
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,928
I didn't know then.

687
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,891
Ms. Hong! We've got a problem.
You need to see this.

688
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,523
I didn't know
just how fragile human life is

689
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,442
and how easily it can shatter.

690
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,952
I just got back today,
so I don't really have anything to offer.

691
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,372
It's fine. I have to get going soon.

692
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,209
Hey, man. What's going on with you?

693
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,380
Well…

694
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,340
I…

695
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,217
I quit soccer.

696
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,761
-What?
-Why are you so surprised?

697
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,054
We aren't the same.

698
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:37,603
It wouldn't have been a surprise
if I'd quit at any point.

699
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,897
Wait, you quit?

700
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,482
What, did you retire? When?

701
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,775
No, it's just…

702
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,194
It's been a few months.

703
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,572
And…

704
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,782
I didn't retire. I was cut.

705
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,201
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

706
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,745
It's embarrassing.

707
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,955
How could I tell you something like that?

708
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,665
And what would that have changed?

709
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,377
We…

710
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,339
live in different worlds now,

711
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,800
and worry about different things.

712
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,387
How could you say that?

713
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,640
Is that all our friendship means to you?

714
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,978
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

715
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,438
Anyway,

716
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,273
what's this?

717
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:24,733
Oh, that.

718
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,569
Hey, Woo-seok.

719
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,529
By any chance,

720
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,199
do you have a wish?

721
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,245
I have regretted this moment

722
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,456
for a very long time.

723
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,570
What the…

724
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,535
Here.

725
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,621
You dropped this, Mr. Hyeon.

726
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:20,831
Oh, I see.

727
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,626
But how do you know my name?

728
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:30,382
Of course I know you.
Everyone in Korea knows who you are.

729
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,341
Right.

730
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,551
Wait, what?

731
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,553
What do you mean…

732
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:36,888
Excuse me?

733
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:55,991
What the…

734
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,042
Where am I?

735
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:36,740
FOREVER CARE NURSING HOME

736
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,033
What is this?

737
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,328
KANG SI-YEOL

738
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,290
Did you sleep well, Si-yeol?

739
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,751
What's going on right now?

740
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,628
What happened?

741
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,171
Why am I suddenly here?

742
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,424
You made a wish, so a price must be paid.

743
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:55,425
What?

744
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,095
Wait, what does Woo-seok's wish
have to do--

745
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,888
Didn't I tell you?

746
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,599
I can grant the wish,
but how I do it is up to me.

747
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,144
Once again, your wish has been granted.

748
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:53,024
NO TAIL TO TELL

749
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,402
Who are you people? What is this?

750
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,446
Since someone became
a world-class soccer player,

751
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:02,117
someone else must step down
to maintain the balance.

752
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,703
-Are you kidding me? You…
-I have only one principle.

753
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,747
I avoid doing even the smallest good deed
and only avoid doing major misdeeds.

754
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,125
Just do it.
Unless it's beyond your capability.

755
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,210
Fine. And of course, you'll pay the price.

756
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,129
There's a story
behind this object, isn't there?

757
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:18,300
Eun-ho, I have a wish.
Could you grant it for me?

758
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,553
When you get out, let's do a job together.

759
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,223
Starting now, I'm going on a fox hunt.

760
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,603
