1
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,428
It's already two hours past 6:00.

2
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,722
She probably forgot about it.

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,058
Let's go.

4
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,184
Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,274
What if she didn't forget?
What if something happened to her?

6
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,068
-Pardon?
-I mean, think about it.

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,819
My face is hard to forget.

8
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,991
I guess, I have no choice but to wait,
for such is my generosity.

9
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,495
Did you not say she treated you
like you were a mad slave?

10
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,790
She must have fled after realizing
she'd get a punishment, not a reward.

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,376
If you'll excuse me,
I must relieve myself.

12
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,354
…one of the few blessings I was born with.

13
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,359
Poverty, misery, sadness and tears.

14
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,403
There's no punishment.

15
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,408
I just wanted to give you these.

16
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,455
I hoped these might bring
a little fortune into your life,

17
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,835
when you were born
into nothing but misfortune.

18
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,385
Dae-chu, make haste.

19
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,178
Let us go now.

20
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,193
If I am no longer allowed
to live a woman's life…

21
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,781
If tonight is my last chance…

22
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,831
Of all times,

23
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,626
and

24
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,753
of all people…

25
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,022
What took you so long?

26
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,274
Do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting--

27
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,558
That…

28
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,518
That would be my reward.

29
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,069
Your Highness.

30
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,448
Your Highness.

31
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,367
Why is your face red?

32
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,369
I just got…

33
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,288
robbed now.

34
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,416
What did they steal?

35
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,129
Well…

36
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,923
It's…

37
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,591
Did you see the bandit's face?

38
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,511
How did he look?

39
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,058
Comely.

40
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,102
Comely…

41
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,313
What? He's comely?

42
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,400
We must find him.

43
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,735
I must have lost my mind.

44
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,154
Why did I do that?

45
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,658
That was ridiculous, even to me.

46
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,286
He must be utterly dumbfounded.

47
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,750
I must go back and explain.

48
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,772
Did he leave?

49
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,608
What do I do?

50
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,237
After tonight,
we won't get to see each other again.

51
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,078
This is why they say
nothing good ever happens at night.

52
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,170
Where did she go?

53
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,760
Oh, dear. It's getting late.

54
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,011
It's the curfew hour!

55
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,679
Close the gates!

56
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,900
But why…

57
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,868
You.

58
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,162
I will catch you no matter what.

59
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,872
Your Highness.

60
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,542
I looked everywhere, but found no one.

61
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,504
It's past the curfew hour.
You must return to the palace.

62
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,339
Let us go back for now.

63
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,381
Yes, Your Highness.

64
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,992
Right, I almost forgot.

65
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,620
The grains are missing?

66
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,332
It wasn't us. It's the work of a thief.

67
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,209
-What?
-Look.

68
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,169
They stole the grains
and left this drawing.

69
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,546
This insolent little…

70
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,390
Gil-dong is truly impressive.

71
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
Who's there?

72
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,498
It is curfew.

73
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,959
Present your pass.

74
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,971
Officer Park?

75
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,308
It's me.

76
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,476
It's you, Eun-jo.

77
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,395
Did you see a man wearing black just now?

78
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,775
Only a glimpse.
I was looking for my shoes.

79
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,111
What's the matter?

80
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,071
Right. The curfew pass.

81
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,573
Oh, never mind.

82
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,033
It's just us.

83
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,370
Security is especially tight today.

84
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,041
This is just between you and me.

85
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,960
Whoever has the Baekjeong mask
is Gil-dong.

86
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,130
Oh.

87
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,008
Did Officer Kang Yun-bok find that out?

88
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,259
No, it's…

89
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,096
Well, you don't know him.

90
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,016
He's a newly appointed aide.

91
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,352
He's a pale, well-groomed man.

92
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,895
Oh, I see.

93
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:45,107
He suspects
those spreading rumors about Gil-dong.

94
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,985
And one of the suspects was questioned.

95
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,695
Who was that?

96
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,867
She's called Lady Dong-ju.
You must know her too.

97
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,380
If I'd come here as Gil-dong, as usual,
I would've been caught.

98
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,818
Ma'am.

99
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,486
You're here.

100
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,824
Why does my baby struggle to fall asleep?

101
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,492
It must be due to malnutrition.

102
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,910
Let me take a look.

103
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,465
This was found in your coat.

104
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,270
I brought the silk shoes.

105
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,028
Why run away?

106
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,614
He's a thief. Of course he ran away.

107
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,948
No.

108
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,743
I'm not talking about the man.

109
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,331
I'm talking about this woman.

110
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,545
Around 8:00 tomorrow morning,

111
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,757
assemble all the court ladies,
including the head court lady.

112
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,973
I will now receive remonstrance.

113
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,099
Let us begin.

114
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,145
By Your Majesty's great wisdom and virtue,

115
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,231
the realm prospers in peace day by day.

116
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,485
It is all thanks to your devoted service.

117
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,947
May Your Majesty take good care
of your royal health

118
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,283
and continue to watch over the realm.

119
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,660
I shall bear it in mind.

120
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,624
Why don't we save the daily praises
for tomorrow

121
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,377
and talk about something more interesting?

122
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,836
I'm so bored here in the palace.

123
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,255
I want to hear about the world out there.

124
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,176
Over the past year,

125
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,722
the storehouses of officials,
including my own, have been robbed.

126
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,015
And apparently,

127
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,143
this thief pretends to be
a righteous outlaw.

128
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,105
There was such an incident?

129
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,232
We must catch the thief.

130
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,110
There is no need
to fuss over some petty thief.

131
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,447
Stories like that have always been around.

132
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,324
It seems like

133
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,911
all of you should be careful.

134
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,666
What do you mean, if I may ask?

135
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,254
The great thief, Im Kkeok-jeong
did not only cut open rice sacks

136
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,714
but also corrupt officials.

137
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,767
What is the name of the thief?

138
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,269
Yes, Your Majesty.

139
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,355
He is known as "the friend on the road,"

140
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,941
and his name is Gil-dong.

141
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,695
Are you sure it isn't
"the poop on the road"?

142
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,238
"Poop"?

143
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,630
The censors' remonstrances are becoming

144
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,382
more and more flattering.

145
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,010
I liked it though.

146
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,304
Do you not like it?

147
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,931
They're all lies.

148
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,185
They're worse than Hong Min-jik.

149
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,786
Chief Censor Hong Min-jik, say that again.

150
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,874
Altering the Sillok annals
is unprecedented in history.

151
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,126
Punishing them based solely on the appeal

152
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,588
would bring great misfortune
upon Your Majesty in the future.

153
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,806
Why don't you offer
your remonstrance as well?

154
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,311
Punishing immoral writings

155
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,358
is right and necessary.

156
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,736
Your Majesty

157
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,823
made the right decision.

158
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,497
Is that so?

159
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,675
Do you miss Hong Min-jik,

160
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,843
Your Majesty?

161
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,306
He may not be to my liking,

162
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,142
but at least he was sincere.

163
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,485
What do you mean?

164
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,488
There's sincerity in here too.

165
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,743
Is that so?

166
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,580
Let me see

167
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,373
where the sincerity is.

168
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,759
Father, are you leaving
the palace already?

169
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,971
I need to meet Min-jik.

170
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,574
Look.

171
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,909
If you don't want it, give it.

172
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,368
I'm cooling it down.

173
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,663
We could go to my house
if you don't like courtesans' house.

174
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,212
This is my bribe.
Please take good care of Eun-jo.

175
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,175
She does not take after you.

176
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,385
She's not soft.

177
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,431
She may seem tender,

178
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,474
but she's strong.

179
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,562
Let it be said that this marriage
was solely my own desire.

180
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:43,025
My desire to live in comfort
under the protection of a powerful family.

181
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,653
I apologize.

182
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,573
What are you apologizing for?

183
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,993
I always feel like I owe you.

184
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,622
You're funny.

185
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,250
Right. I will send the wedding gifts back.

186
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,712
Please take them. They're for the girl.

187
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,423
They would only be
a burden to my daughter.

188
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,550
You paid a bride price worth a house.

189
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,053
Just how hard do you want
to work my daughter?

190
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,433
You make me ashamed of myself, as always.

191
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,354
Is there a reason why

192
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,189
you came to see me?

193
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,944
No.

194
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,697
I just wanted to say hello.

195
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,484
You've been frowning all day long.

196
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,528
What's the matter?

197
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,904
Oh.

198
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,074
I was just thinking
about the book I read yesterday.

199
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,119
What is it about?

200
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,246
I don't know how to read, so tell me.

201
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,794
So, the story is…

202
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,213
about a woman.

203
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,257
The Grand Prince has summoned us.

204
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,093
-Will he tell us stories again?
-About his achievements?

205
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,305
-Me!
-Me!

206
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,141
You there.

207
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,271
If the woman kissed first,

208
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,231
it must be love.

209
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,609
Love?

210
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,488
No, it was the first time we met.

211
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,783
So it was love at first sight.

212
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,247
Well, I do have the looks for it.

213
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,084
So the woman in the book
fell in love with the man.

214
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,835
What? No!

215
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,087
Then why did she run away?

216
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,967
Because she was startled
by what she had done.

217
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,391
And the next thing she knew,
she'd already run away.

218
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,895
Clearly, she just tested the water
and ran off.

219
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,064
If it's love at first sight,
why would she run away?

220
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,441
If she had run off with him,
that would be love.

221
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,447
Why do you think she ran away?

222
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,158
Maybe she realized
the water she tested was too lukewarm.

223
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,077
It happens.

224
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,830
She kissed him, full of anticipation.

225
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:46,917
She expected butterflies
and sparks and all that.

226
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,293
But no.

227
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,255
All she felt was the cold breath
coming from his nose.

228
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:55,592
That's when she started
feeling uncomfortable.

229
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,348
Don't answer my questions from now on.

230
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,351
-Why?
-I told you not to ask questions too.

231
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,146
Goodness. Then why did she even kiss him?

232
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,107
She is dying to know that herself.

233
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,902
But no matter how hard she thinks,
she can't find the answer.

234
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,907
That's when you use
your heart to understand.

235
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,452
Heart?

236
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,290
Love is like that.

237
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,210
You can never understand it
with your head.

238
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,630
No, it's not love.

239
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,675
It shouldn't be love.

240
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,428
She's engaged.

241
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,725
I know it's just a story,
but what a bad woman.

242
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,227
She should be punished for what she did.

243
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,272
Right?

244
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,648
Of course.

245
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,408
A few lashes wouldn't be
nearly enough, would they?

246
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,827
May I?

247
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,499
Though she kissed him for love,
it may have been a forbidden love

248
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,377
that could never be fulfilled.

249
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,297
Forbidden?

250
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,425
That kind of love
is bound to be deep and intense.

251
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,303
Like a noble lady and a slave.

252
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,598
A mistress and a slave?

253
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,268
A slave.

254
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,686
Slave boy!

255
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,563
Boy. He's my slave boy.

256
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,400
It is true that she thinks I'm a slave.

257
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,653
Is that why she thought
it was forbidden love?

258
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,155
Let me ask you a question.

259
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,157
If that slave

260
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,827
turns out to be a noble man…

261
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,084
or even a Grand Prince…

262
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,341
You always respond in the same way.

263
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,551
Should I take it
as a good sign or a bad sign?

264
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,679
About the slave talk earlier…

265
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,889
Were you referring to your friend?

266
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,891
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

267
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,394
I don't have a friend.

268
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,853
Of course it was me.

269
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,398
So what was stolen from you yesterday
was a kiss?

270
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,862
I will go to the constabulary
on my own from here.

271
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,116
What about me?
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

272
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,160
You have a very important thing to do.

273
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,427
My beautiful face
makes the fabric look dull. Doesn't it?

274
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,929
Are you sure it is not because

275
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,348
of the dark cloud hanging over your face?

276
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,184
What is it? What's bothering you now?

277
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,896
I don't know. Everything.

278
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,774
Everything is bothering me.

279
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,402
And this woman here will be my concubine.

280
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,446
No, maybe you already are.

281
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,242
Wait here. I will go
and have them all changed.

282
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,869
Don't bother.

283
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,456
I don't have the courage to defy the fate
my brother has set for me.

284
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,790
What?

285
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,335
I will go with this.
Eventually, it will grow on me.

286
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,129
And eventually, it will look pretty to me.

287
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,049
Madam, the silk dress
I had tailored the other day…

288
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,514
I will come back later.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

289
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,891
Can I speak with you briefly?

290
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,896
Could you leave us alone?

291
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,564
Yes, my lady.

292
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,491
I just got my new wig.

293
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,703
If you could pull it gently,
that would be great.

294
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,128
Did you just say "support"?

295
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,423
Yes, that is what I said.

296
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,592
I would like to support both my husband

297
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,843
and the love between you two.

298
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,513
From what I was taught,
that is a wife's virtue.

299
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,558
Who taught you that was a virtue?
Your father or your mother?

300
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,644
I lost both my parents when I was five.

301
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,479
I learned about the virtue

302
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,107
from a book.

303
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,567
From a book?

304
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,949
So you have no intention
of slapping my face

305
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,201
or pulling my hair?

306
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,205
Slap what?

307
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,249
Look, Young Master.

308
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,792
I've been a courtesan for ten years,

309
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,294
and I've never seen a wife
who wants to befriend a concubine.

310
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,212
Oh, dear.

311
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,632
So my fiancée has such a big heart

312
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,260
that she finds good in everything,
even in her enemies.

313
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,220
You can call off the wedding if you want,

314
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,931
but from now on, do not use me
for your silly little games.

315
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,519
Why is No-eul so upset?

316
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,690
Because the one who should be upset
chose compassion.

317
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,819
Pleading might work better
on my big-hearted fiancée than bullying.

318
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,327
Dropped! You'll get a penalty.

319
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,624
You can't hit even a single shot.
I thought your father was in the military.

320
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,751
You're no better yourself.

321
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,921
My family has produced
great scholars for generations.

322
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,090
Brushes are our swords.

323
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,720
But then again, look what happened
to your father with his sharp tongue.

324
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,804
What did you just say?

325
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,724
My sister, Eun-jo,
would have hit them all.

326
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,726
What?

327
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,145
How dare you compare
a concubine's daughter to us?

328
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,774
Enough with that.

329
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,152
But he started it.

330
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:53,200
When Eun-jo was little,
she played with bows instead of dolls.

331
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,784
She's twice as good an archer as you.

332
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,661
She's just a woman. Stop bluffing.

333
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,163
-Want a bet?
-Sure!

334
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,540
You grown-up men
are acting like little boys.

335
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,002
What are you betting?

336
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,214
Just like love,
fights are meant to be encouraged.

337
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,679
-Your Highness.
-Hello.

338
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,097
I received your message.

339
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,850
-So, Gil-dong robbed again?
-Yes, Your Highness.

340
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,894
By the way,

341
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,649
-is Your Highness unaccompanied?
-Oh, Dae-chu?

342
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,777
Has anyone seen this woman?

343
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:34,783
I must find this woman!
Only then can I return home!

344
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,534
Dae-chu is looking for silk shoes.

345
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,412
Do you fancy silk shoes?

346
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,041
Well, they have
lovely colors and patterns.

347
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,668
But most of all,

348
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,544
they have a lovely personality.

349
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,339
Silk shoes have a lovely personality?

350
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,466
It's a human.

351
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,720
And everything about them is lovely,
so it must be a woman.

352
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,555
Why don't you stop
investigating my business

353
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,516
and investigate the theft instead?

354
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,021
-Is this the drawing Gil-dong left?
-Yes, Your Highness.

355
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,359
There's no consistency whatsoever
in the items he steals.

356
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,111
Indeed, Your Highness.

357
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,237
Why seaweed?

358
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,490
I wonder if his wife
gave birth or something.

359
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,330
-You're here.
-Did you call for me?

360
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,750
On the night Gil-dong stole the seaweed,
Officer Park saw a suspicious man.

361
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,252
Is that so?

362
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,963
I'm not sure if it was Gil-dong,
but it was a very nimble man.

363
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:35,302
Actually, Eun-jo must have seen him
better than me.

364
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,512
-Physician Hong was there too?
-Yes.

365
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,930
Do you know the physician?

366
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,725
A woman's corpse is supposed to be
examined by a female physician.

367
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,728
So whenever we lack female officers,
we get help from Physician Hong.

368
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,065
Where is that physician now?

369
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,988
Eun-jo!

370
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,283
Young Master?

371
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,367
What is the matter?

372
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,661
I need you to follow me somewhere.

373
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,623
-A bet?
-Yes.

374
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,293
You just need to hit this apple here.

375
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,258
Are you sure you have the time for this?

376
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,635
You have
a civil service examination to pass.

377
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,097
Do you hang out with those men every day?

378
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,227
They're the only ones who hang out with me
since our family's fallen.

379
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,314
And now, we're like family.

380
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,909
I'll win the bet for you,
if you promise me one thing.

381
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,205
That concubine's daughter
looks familiar somehow.

382
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,581
How unpleasant.

383
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,627
She doesn't know her place
and acts like his sister.

384
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,545
How annoying.

385
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,936
Didn't she refuse to do it at first?

386
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,687
Why did she change her mind?

387
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,940
-Because I agreed to promise one thing.
-A promise?

388
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,151
I agreed to stop hanging out with you two
if she wins.

389
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,447
Is that so?

390
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,328
You.

391
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,996
Do you really not know me?

392
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,249
You look strangely familiar.

393
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,586
Well, I don't think we have met before.

394
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,840
Can I start now?

395
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,259
Wait.

396
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,221
We should change the rules.

397
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,227
You raised the stakes.

398
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,146
Pardon?

399
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,149
If you made your brother
promise something so serious,

400
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,735
you need to risk something too.

401
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,491
Why don't you stand there
instead of the target?

402
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,872
-Jae-i.
-What?

403
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,332
Do you not want to?

404
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,252
What's the matter?

405
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,004
Are you upset?

406
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,589
Not yet.

407
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,715
Go stand there.

408
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,025
You can do it, right?

409
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,205
Eun-jo.

410
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,373
Please.

411
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,213
Please…

412
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,673
Please…

413
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,692
I only meant for him
to focus on his studies until the exam.

414
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,113
If this is because
of what I asked him to promise me,

415
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,448
please punish me instead.

416
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,783
I am punishing you.

417
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,662
Does it look like
I'm punishing Dae-il now?

418
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,791
The more Dae-il shivers in fear,

419
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,461
the more your hands tremble.

420
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,632
I'm punishing the right person.

421
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,971
Why would you…

422
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,682
go to such lengths?

423
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,103
It's disgusting to see
a lowly concubine's daughter

424
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,187
acting like his sister.

425
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,898
You're a concubine's child.

426
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,733
It's against propriety and order.

427
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,614
I did not try to act like his sister.

428
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,952
I simply followed my heart.

429
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,248
If my heart itself
is against propriety and order,

430
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,334
I apologize.

431
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,194
Of course.

432
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,157
A woman can't shoot an arrow.
It was all a bluff.

433
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,494
What?

434
00:31:55,955 --> 00:32:00,084
I received my punishment,
so please honor your promise.

435
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,848
Well, this is bad.

436
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,893
I bet my favorite waist sash on this.

437
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,269
You can tie it again.

438
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,362
Did you shoot a flying sparrow?

439
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,866
Well done! You hit a target
that was smaller and farther away.

440
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,451
It's a perfect victory.

441
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,375
My word.

442
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,502
It pierced right through the heart.

443
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,966
Your future sister-in-law
has quite the talent.

444
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,010
Sister-in-law?

445
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,553
Did you not know?

446
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,514
She will be your brother's concubine.

447
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,394
Lord Im Sa-hyeong's second son?

448
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,853
Why are you saying this now?

449
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,022
I told you, they're like my family.

450
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,274
He's our brother-in-law, to be precise.

451
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,321
To be really precise,
he'd be my grandson-in-law.

452
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,031
This is getting messy.

453
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,201
Why are all those people gathered there?

454
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,582
Go ahead without me.

455
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,128
I must tend
to Chief Censor's wife by 2:00.

456
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,936
Nothing's been caught,
other than the Baekjeong mask.

457
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,188
Until the investigation quietens down,

458
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,941
I will have to keep myself
from being nosy.

459
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,079
Right, I forgot about that.

460
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,168
Oh?

461
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,323
Your Highness, just now…

462
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,616
Is the female physician here?

463
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,162
Your Majesty.

464
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,459
Mother. What brings you here?

465
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,798
Are you Officer Kang Yun-bok?

466
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,466
Yes, Your Majesty.

467
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,010
If I ever set foot here again,

468
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,680
it will be with an order for your arrest.

469
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,353
You may leave now.

470
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,865
Why did you refuse
Chief Censor's daughter?

471
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,827
She was unsightly.

472
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,583
You do not belong at the constabulary.

473
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,085
Playing officer is

474
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,504
my little hobby
that even his Majesty has allowed.

475
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,756
When will you stop
living like a scoundrel?

476
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,757
A scoundrel.

477
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,425
An idler. A shameless wretch.

478
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,178
Not anybody can be called these.

479
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,389
Only I, a Grand Prince…

480
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,895
How much more…

481
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,190
How much more disappointment
must I endure?

482
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,402
There will be no more disappointment

483
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,821
so long as you place

484
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,282
no expectations upon me.

485
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,118
You…

486
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,204
You are…

487
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,813
Her Majesty seemed quite upset.

488
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,940
Shouldn't you do something?

489
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,693
Nothing.

490
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,446
Keep your brilliance
hidden from the world.

491
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,200
Keep yourself from my sight,
and do nothing.

492
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,619
I will do nothing.

493
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,373
Your Highness is especially cold
to Her Majesty.

494
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,377
It's good for her that I'm a bad son.

495
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,340
Don't take what Her Majesty said earlier
too much to heart.

496
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,259
Her Majesty was merely letting off steam.

497
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,680
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

498
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,682
It is nothing, Your Highness.

499
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,019
This waiting is getting tedious.

500
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,689
Let me go and meet Physician Hong myself.

501
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,858
My lady.

502
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,818
Are you looking at it?

503
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,413
Why? Is it really that interesting?

504
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,667
Why would anyone read this?

505
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,710
I know he will be my husband,

506
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,171
but I really cannot understand
the appeal of this.

507
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,091
Oh, dear. That's intense.

508
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,261
Could you turn the page?

509
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,640
I hear Gil-dong is a Baekjeong.

510
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,599
Gil-dong?

511
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,103
I want to get out.

512
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,855
Hey, move. Make way.

513
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,781
This man is full of charm.

514
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,535
You speak as if you can see
his face behind the mask.

515
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,495
Yes, I can see it.

516
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,872
I can see his heart, not his face.

517
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,669
SEEKING THIS MAN

518
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,338
Who is this man?

519
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,132
"Name, unknown."

520
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,968
"Notable remarks, a dullard."

521
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,929
"Fusses over cold water
and says it's like a thunderbolt."

522
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,764
"Disrespectful, regardless of company."

523
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,641
Enough reading for now, my lady.
Let us go.

524
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,810
-We must stop by the Hyeminseo.
-Sure.

525
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,355
Goodbye.

526
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,448
I thought you might be hungry,
so I bought these on my way.

527
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,534
You should call the patients over.
I bought enough to share.

528
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,247
I know you used the snacks
as an excuse to wander around the market.

529
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,249
You must conduct yourself properly.

530
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,085
That is not…

531
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,420
No talking back.

532
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,967
You must return home before sunset.

533
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,136
Yes, Father.

534
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,696
Oh, a dullard.

535
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,120
Why do you look at me, Your Highness?

536
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,416
Pardon me.

537
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,168
See? She's talking to you.

538
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,253
May I help you?

539
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,589
By any chance,

540
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,842
is the man next to you a dullard?

541
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,594
I can hear you.

542
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,723
You are mistaken.

543
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,475
-He is--
-I'm an aide.

544
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,977
I apologize.

545
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,438
You look like a dullard
someone is looking for,

546
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,523
so I asked.

547
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,525
Don't worry.

548
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,653
Surprisingly, it isn't my first time
being called a dullard.

549
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,198
Well, then, if you'll excuse me…

550
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,424
Watch out.

551
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,844
By the way,

552
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,012
what was Physician Hong
doing there late at night?

553
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,140
Women don't usually go out
at such a late hour.

554
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,642
Well, you may ask her yourself.

555
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,568
Look, Jeom-baek.

556
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,488
Where is Physician Hong?

557
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,073
Eun-jo is off duty today.

558
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,160
Oh, dear. Where would she be now?

559
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,164
Whenever she's off duty,
she goes around seeing patients.

560
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,415
So we do not know.

561
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,834
We can't see her today either?

562
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,752
It is really hard to meet this physician.

563
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,504
Your Highness.

564
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,010
These are the people
who have visited the widow.

565
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,220
"Lady next door, lady across the road,

566
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,723
lady from the house behind,
lady two doors down,

567
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,100
female shaman, female physician."

568
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,145
Were there any male visitors?

569
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,229
No, Your Highness.

570
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,981
She didn't leave her house?

571
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,900
I don't know if this counts,

572
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,986
but about two hours earlier,
she was stripped of all her belongings

573
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,404
and was dragged to her master.

574
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,615
Who is her master?

575
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,908
Chief Censor.

576
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,202
Wait.

577
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,455
Gil-dong robbed
Chief Censor's storehouse yesterday.

578
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,543
Did anyone see smoke rising
from that house's chimney?

579
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,961
Yes, Your Highness.

580
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,173
I was told
they cooked rice in the morning.

581
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,135
What's the matter, Your Highness?

582
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,642
Go and bring that widow
to the constabulary at once.

583
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,906
I can finally move my shoulders.

584
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,077
How's your insomnia these days?

585
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,206
I think I'll only get some sleep
when I'm dead.

586
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,000
My lord!

587
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,461
The child has done no wrong!

588
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,090
Is something happening?

589
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,802
What a sweet baby.

590
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,390
The baby has put on some weight.

591
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,685
It means the mother had milk
to feed the baby.

592
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,815
You had no money to give to your master,

593
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,650
yet you had food to eat?

594
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,070
These were found in her house.

595
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,294
Where did you get this rice?

596
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:09,837
That's…

597
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,382
That's what I gave her last night.

598
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,843
Do you have a pimp now?

599
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,053
Eat it.

600
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,722
Eat it.

601
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,474
Come on. Eat it.

602
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,809
Eat it.

603
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,776
Seize all her possessions
and send her back empty-handed.

604
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,194
Yes, my lord.

605
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,240
My lord.

606
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,495
I beg your pardon,

607
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,414
but the baby and the mother

608
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:49,168
have been unable to eat
and suffering from malnutrition.

609
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,713
Please show mercy
and allow her to keep the rice at least.

610
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,965
My wife said that

611
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,468
you were a decent physician,

612
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,720
so I thought well of you.

613
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,308
But you don't know your place.

614
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,814
I'm a physician,
and these two are my patients.

615
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,025
That is why I beg this favor of you.

616
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,612
She needs to eat
for the medicine to take effect.

617
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,451
Unlike humans,

618
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,621
beasts die once their purpose is served.

619
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,666
That is how the world works.

620
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,776
Go home for now.
I will stop by later tonight.

621
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,167
I was going to stay quiet
for the time being, but…

622
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,970
Heading to Chief Censor's storehouse?

623
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,025
Who is he?

624
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,988
Do not worry.

625
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,158
This is not where you will die.

626
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,746
What?

627
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,082
What?

628
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,333
Are you coming over?

629
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,420
Slave boy?

630
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,256
Why don't you just stay there?

631
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,341
I'd rather have some space between us.

632
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,970
No, I must be mistaken.

633
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,054
What are you doing?

634
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,266
That's his voice. I wasn't mistaken.

635
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,893
What?

636
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,645
What's the slave boy doing here?

637
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,858
I knew you wouldn't be an ordinary man,

638
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,944
but you're far more peculiar
than I thought.

639
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,114
Wait, that he knows I was going
to Chief Censor's storehouse means…

640
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,282
Gil-dong.

641
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,743
He knows me.

642
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,077
But how?

643
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,247
But before that, how does he look so sane?

644
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,042
Are you amazed by my insight,
seeing how I was already waiting here?

645
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,254
What are you nodding about?

646
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,714
What is happening?

647
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,174
I can't believe how I look either.

648
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,759
You may not believe me but it's true.

649
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,093
You may not believe this, but…

650
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,055
Is this all because I did not believe him?

651
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,432
Wait, does this mean…

652
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,102
I thought the silk clothes
he was wearing were borrowed.

653
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,396
Does this mean he's really not a slave?

654
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,940
When theft is your trade,

655
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,817
you're bound to get acquainted
with an aide or two.

656
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,361
No need to be so startled.

657
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,322
An aide?

658
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,199
He's a newly appointed aide.

659
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,659
He's a pale, well-groomed man.

660
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:09,993
This cannot be true.

661
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,287
There's no time to be in shock.

662
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,122
-I must run--
-Stop.

663
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,541
I won't chase you.

664
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,001
If I intended to catch you,

665
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,754
I would have tailed you
to find who you were.

666
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,401
You know where the thief is
and yet you won't give chase?

667
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,194
If Chief Constable finds out…

668
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,031
Go and bring that widow
to the constabulary at once.

669
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,283
Yes, Your Highness.

670
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,289
But we don't have any evidence.

671
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,458
Where do you think a widow
who didn't even have money for her master

672
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,543
got the rice?

673
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,840
Could it be Gil-dong…

674
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,884
The rumor that Gil-dong
is a righteous thief might be true.

675
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,138
And if it is true,

676
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,932
how much would it be worth?

677
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,102
Where could he be?

678
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,076
Yes.

679
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,078
I took it.

680
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,797
I ate it.

681
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,637
Because I was hungry.

682
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:57,434
And I bet other people who owe Gil-dong
did the same.

683
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:02,105
This was stolen. Do not tell anyone.

684
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,570
It is my fault
that the rumor is going around.

685
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:12,240
I was so happy to receive
what I didn't deserve

686
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,702
that I forgot about Gil-dong's request
and ran my mouth.

687
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,704
But I will not cause any more trouble.

688
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,917
I'm the one who was fed with stolen rice.

689
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,044
Arrest me.

690
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,898
The officer who questioned me

691
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,109
sent me all this?

692
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,904
He'd like you to just accept them.

693
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,869
The Grand Prince said to me,

694
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,873
"How could I blame
the widow and her child for their hunger?"

695
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,462
And how could I blame Gil-dong

696
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,215
for not overlooking the hunger

697
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,759
of a widow and her child?

698
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,975
And I don't have the answer yet.

699
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,068
Why does he say he wouldn't catch me?

700
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,321
But I will not support your theft either.

701
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:38,493
Neither will I blame Joseon
for ignoring corrupt officials. However…

702
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,454
However?

703
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,539
I will allow you

704
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,584
to look after your neighbors your way.

705
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,296
Does he want me to continue the theft?

706
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,047
Right.

707
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,091
The widow had a message for you.

708
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,343
Gil-dong always came by

709
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,430
whenever I was hungry and sick,

710
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,057
although I don't know how he always knew.

711
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,895
The smartest person I know

712
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,939
once said this to me.

713
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,865
Hunger alone is misery enough,

714
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,993
yet to suffer
my master's beatings as well…

715
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,873
I am so sick of this life.

716
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,461
I have been a physician
for only five years now,

717
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,922
but I have learned something in that time.

718
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,593
When a person is hungry and ill,

719
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,554
it is the heart that suffers most.

720
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,808
Is that so?

721
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,437
And when your heart is deeply hurt,

722
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,231
that is when

723
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,274
no medicine works.

724
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,780
No matter how fine the medicine,

725
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:00,700
it cannot reach a wounded heart.

726
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,119
That person said to me

727
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,288
that sometimes, it's not fancy medicine

728
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,626
but a bowl of rice prepared with love
that heals a person.

729
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,421
And that's exactly what happened to me.

730
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,632
THIS WAS STOLEN. DO NOT TELL ANYONE.

731
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,204
The rice I swallowed
through the lump in my throat…

732
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,424
reached and touched my heart deeply.

733
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,760
So each time he came by,

734
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,223
the warmth he left behind
made me so happy.

735
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,814
She said she was happy to have known you

736
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,233
and thanked you.

737
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,363
This is how I knew you'd go
to Chief Censor's storehouse tonight.

738
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,033
It's all thanks to the widow.

739
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,994
I thought you'd come back tonight

740
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,538
to see the widow and the baby
exploited by Chief Censor

741
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,165
based on what she told me.

742
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,548
And you're where I predicted you would be.

743
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,051
From now on,

744
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,262
stay within my expectations.

745
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,766
Just stay within

746
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,518
what I can handle.

747
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,772
What does this mean?

748
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,231
Does he really mean that?

749
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,485
But if you go beyond my forbearance

750
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,488
and threaten the foundations of Joseon,
I will arrest you.

751
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,282
Bear this in mind.

752
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,701
Just because I do not chase you

753
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,329
does not mean I let you go.

754
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,089
Isn't that Gil-dong?

755
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,217
He looks just like the sketch.

756
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,178
It's Gil-dong! Gil-dong is here!

757
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,180
Oh, no.

758
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,767
He was just stalling for time.

759
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,851
Wait.

760
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,646
Stop!

761
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,066
He's here!

762
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,663
Hasn't the arrest order been canceled?

763
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,831
It was canceled so urgently

764
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,792
that it seems it never reached
the officers already out on patrol.

765
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,170
There's a ball of cotton
instead of the arrowhead.

766
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,006
Enough with the act and get up.

767
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,552
This unnecessary chase
could put His Highness in danger.

768
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,303
Guard His Highness first.

769
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,267
Stop there!

770
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,899
Stop the attack!

771
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,041
What kind of twisted fate is this?

772
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,959
From now on,

773
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,961
stay within my expectations.

774
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,047
Just stay within

775
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,174
what I can handle.

776
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,054
I almost fell for it.

777
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,106
I hope he escaped safely.

778
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,169
HYEMINSEO

779
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,875
Why did he come here?

780
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,795
Is he after Gil-dong?

781
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,429
I saw the lantern was lit, so I came in.

782
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,850
Oh, no. What do I do?

783
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,939
Hyeminseo is closed now. Please leave.

784
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,568
Is it you?

785
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,117
It's you, isn't it?

786
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,786
Should I just run now?

787
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,547
It is you.

788
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,014
The silk shoes.

789
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,475
Silk shoes?

790
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,894
The flowery rain.

791
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,229
Flowery rain?

792
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,630
There you are.

793
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,176
Lady Flower.

794
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,912
What happened to your arm?
Did you get hurt?

795
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,581
You said you would only look.

796
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,666
Just looking won't do.

797
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,668
You must be close to the Grand Prince.

798
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,461
We are very close.

799
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,879
I heard he was a philanderer.

800
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,631
I told you to donate anonymously.

801
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,592
There are unsavory rumors
about Your Highness.

802
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,759
This should be made known.

803
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:57,677
They're my rumors.

804
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,387
Put a man on the Grand Prince.

805
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,181
Find out whom he meets and where he goes.

806
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,975
You didn't even realize you got hurt.

807
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:04,976
Are you always dull?

808
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:08,187
Does he know that
you're marrying a man in his 70s?

809
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,149
It will be interesting if he finds out.

810
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,109
What are you doing now?

811
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,485
I'm courting you.

812
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,945
Is there a man you hold dear?

813
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,991
