1
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,083
Whoa, scary.

2
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,833
NOTICE OF POWER OUTAGE

3
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,083
I'm done for.

4
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,000
This is bad.

5
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,458
All right!

6
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,416
Oh, no.

7
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,458
Hana?

8
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,333
What are you doing here so early?

9
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,250
Oh…

10
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,250
Um.

11
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,083
Well, uh…

12
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,000
-I think I dropped something.
-Huh?

13
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,958
Good morning.

14
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,000
-Good morning.
-That's odd.

15
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,541
Hmm?

16
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,708
Oh!

17
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,041
I thought our practice was over.

18
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,500
I think it's best to stop

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,375
for everyone's sake.

20
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,583
PURE KENJI

21
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,041
Could you…

22
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,208
LE SAUVEUR CLOSURE PLAN

23
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,458
…give Le Sauveur another chance?

24
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,500
Please, sir.

25
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,375
Lately, I've been worried
about our major shareholders' moves.

26
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,875
Even the smallest management misstep

27
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,166
could be used against us
by them or the board.

28
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:27,125
That's why Le Sauveur has to win
the World Chocolatier Masters.

29
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,916
We'll prove we're the best in the world

30
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,625
and bring profits to Futago Confectionery.

31
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,333
Winning the World Chocolatier Masters?

32
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,708
If you can prove your dream is right,

33
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,916
I'll consider it.

34
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,291
Thank you.

35
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,375
Come in.

36
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,708
Excuse me.

37
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,541
Here's the entry plan
for the World Chocolatier Masters

38
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,625
that you mentioned before.

39
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,791
I brainstormed
with the other chocolatiers.

40
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,083
We want to compete
with a slightly refined version

41
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,250
of the Bonbon Sakura.

42
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,125
It's a tough call,

43
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:41,416
but let's go with Pure Kenji,
Le Sauveur's signature product.

44
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,250
Do you mean we'll enter
the Anonymous Chocolatier?

45
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,083
That's right.

46
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:55,916
Le Sauveur must win
the upcoming competition.

47
00:05:56,416 --> 00:06:02,583
To do that, I believe we should pick
the best of the seven chocolates.

48
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:17,458
Each shop’s head chocolatier enters,
so that should be you, Chief.

49
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,166
It's the first competition
since Chef Kenji passed away.

50
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,875
For Le Sauveur to win,

51
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:33,708
we need someone
as skilled as the Anonymous Chocolatier.

52
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,916
I can't accept that.

53
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,666
Um,

54
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,666
do we really need

55
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,875
the Anonymous Chocolatier
to help Le Sauveur?

56
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,875
About that…

57
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,250
I'm actually the--

58
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,958
Chief, I heard about it!

59
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,333
You should be the one to enter.

60
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,916
I mean, all they do is sneak around
and never show up to work.

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,333
Chef Kenji valued them for their talent.

62
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,750
but you and the rest of us
have been doing all the work!

63
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,375
Exactly.

64
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,875
No matter how great
the Anonymous Chocolatier is,

65
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,208
I won't back someone I don't know.

66
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,708
Yeah, same here!

67
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:42,958
I can't stand them
competing in my place either.

68
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:48,208
But… for Le Sauveur's sake,

69
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,208
we need their help.

70
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,541
Gosh. I'm pathetic, huh?

71
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,541
Chief, that's not true.

72
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,166
Come on, Chief.

73
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,333
I'm gonna go talk to the boss.

74
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,583
Excuse me, Chief?

75
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,416
I have something to tell you.

76
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,333
I am…

77
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,583
the Anonymous Chocolatier…

78
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,000
I mean,

79
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,625
I can be their point of contact.

80
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,791
You can?

81
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,708
Wait, how?

82
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,458
Truth is,

83
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,375
I've been in touch with them now and then.

84
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,750
What? Really?

85
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,791
Uh, yes.

86
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,291
I'm a big fan of Pure Kenji.

87
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,916
So I'll try to convince them

88
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,583
to share the recipe

89
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,208
with Team Le Sauveur
before the competition.

90
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:10,208
But I doubt they'll come here.

91
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,083
Then what if they teach us remotely?

92
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,166
Oh, seriously.

93
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,541
I mean, it's my fault
for saying I'd do this.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay.

95
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,833
Okay, we're ready to begin.

96
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,875
Thank you for joining us.

97
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,500
Yes.

98
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,458
Oh.

99
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,958
The cacao beans
are mainly Peruvian Criollo,

100
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:06,625
blended with Trinitario cacao from Koita,

101
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,541
is what they're saying.

102
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:11,916
Okay.

103
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,750
As you all know,

104
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,250
conducting the whole process
from roasting to melanging

105
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,833
would take us about four days.

106
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:31,166
So I've been given
pre-blocked chocolate for today.

107
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,541
Is it in here?

108
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,500
Oh, here it is.

109
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:38,958
Here you go.

110
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,750
Thank you.

111
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,541
Careful, it's hot.

112
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,208
Oh, now! Please check the temperature…

113
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,166
is what they're saying.

114
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,208
It's the same Pure Kenji we know.

115
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,416
That's a relief.

116
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,541
It's really good.

117
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,791
Mind if I try one too?

118
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,708
Go ahead.

119
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,333
Thanks.

120
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,166
It's delicious.

121
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,791
Thank you so much
for sharing your precious recipe.

122
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,791
Thank you!

123
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,041
It's my pleasure.

124
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,125
Please do your best
in making the best chocolate…

125
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,916
is what they said.

126
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:43,250
Okay, I'd like to end our remote call
with the Anonymous Chocolatier.

127
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,708
We appreciate your time.

128
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,583
Thank you for your time!

129
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,500
Great work, everyone.

130
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,791
Thank you.

131
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,166
-Thank you.
-Thanks!

132
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,250
Chief, go crush the competition.

133
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,583
I got this.

134
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,750
LE SAUVEUR CLOSURE PLAN

135
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,125
Mr. Fujiwara, I noticed something odd.

136
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,708
Hm? What is it?

137
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:59,666
Hana's laptop wasn't connected
to any website today.

138
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,375
I checked her private IP address.

139
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,750
Even though it's on Le Sauveur's Wi-Fi,

140
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,125
there's no record of any web access today.

141
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,708
What? But she gave us
real-time instructions.

142
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,291
And thanks to her,
we managed to make Pure Kenji.

143
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:22,000
That means Hana could teach
how to make Pure Kenji without any help.

144
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,583
In other words,
she's the Anonymous Chocolatier.

145
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,125
-Huh?
-What?

146
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,416
What?

147
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Wait, are you serious?

148
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,750
The newbie's the genius chocolatier?

149
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,291
W-Wait a second.

150
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,708
Even if that's true,

151
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,333
why lie about it all this time?

152
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,583
Hana!

153
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,333
Wait, Hana!

154
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,041
Is it true what Takashi said?

155
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:21,375
I just wanted to help Le Sauveur.

156
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,625
But why did you lie about it?

157
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,166
Th-That's…

158
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,291
I tried to tell you so many times.

159
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,458
Then why didn't you?

160
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,333
I couldn't trust you then.

161
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,333
Hana…

162
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:49,583
Just how much of you is real?

163
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,208
What about you?

164
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,375
You just wanted my recipe, didn't you?

165
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,750
You came to steal Chef Kenji's recipe.

166
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,500
You're planning to shut Le Sauveur down!

167
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,250
I trusted you.

168
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,083
No, that's not…

169
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,041
I asked for everyone's help
to not let that happen.

170
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:20,125
To save Le Sauveur,
we have to win this competition.

171
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,750
-Hana.
-What's the matter?

172
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,541
Taxi!

173
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,958
We've got the recipe now.

174
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,125
We don't need her anymore, do we?

175
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:47,125
To save Le Sauveur,
we have to win this competition.

176
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,458
Koita.

177
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:32,958
Now then, please make sure
you're fully prepared for the competition.

178
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,375
Mr. Fujiwara.

179
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,166
Yes?

180
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,958
I think

181
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,333
for Le Sauveur's future,

182
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,500
we need the Anonymous Chocolatier.

183
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,833
With everyone's help,

184
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,166
I've done everything I can.

185
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,416
But…

186
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,000
the taste is slightly off.

187
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,208
It might be difficult
to recreate the same flavor.

188
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,750
It hurts my pride,
but that doesn't matter.

189
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:17,041
What matters more is protecting
our life here making chocolate.

190
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,208
So,

191
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:26,875
please help us persuade Hana
to enter the World Chocolatier Masters

192
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,291
with her Pure Kenji.

193
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,333
Please.

194
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,333
-Please.
-Please.

195
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,125
But Hana deceived us all.

196
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,083
We can't just forgive her
for breaking our trust.

197
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,000
I…

198
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,041
I think Hana's a good person.

199
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,041
I never meant to deceive anyone either.

200
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,666
At my last job,
people talked behind my back.

201
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,625
That's why

202
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,875
I decided to stay quiet.

203
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,291
I'm sorry.

204
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,083
No, not at all.

205
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,833
But don't you think

206
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,125
in some way, we all wear a mask?

207
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,458
Takuya,

208
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,375
you actually talk a lot,
and you say good things too.

209
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,416
Plus, you have a great voice.

210
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,333
That surprised me.

211
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,958
Same here.

212
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:34,000
Chef Kenji accepted me as I am.

213
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:40,666
He said, "Here at Le Sauveur,
you can be whoever you want to be."

214
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,625
"You don't need words to make chocolate."

215
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,458
"Just your heart is enough."

216
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,666
That's why, for me,

217
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,375
I've been happy here at Le Sauveur.

218
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,708
Because all of you accepted me as I am…

219
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,375
I'm slowly recovering
from my emotional issues.

220
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,791
And I think

221
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,291
Le Sauveur was
that kind of place for Hana too.

222
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:24,583
Hana sincerely apologized to us.

223
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,958
To my family at Le Sauveur.

224
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,208
Hello.

225
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:44,166
Since I was little, I've had scopophobia,

226
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,750
so I can't stand in front of you all.

227
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:53,958
Therefore, I hope to convey
my feelings through this letter.

228
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,791
For a long time,
I'd been Chef Kenji's apprentice.

229
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,916
I'm the Anonymous Chocolatier, Lee Hana.

230
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:09,666
Working with everyone at Le Sauveur

231
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,750
has been a true joy.

232
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,541
I never meant to deceive you.

233
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,333
Because of my mental illness,

234
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:23,166
I've always lived my life
averting my eyes from the world.

235
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,875
So I lacked confidence

236
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:31,500
and thought no one could ever love me.

237
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,708
But after meeting you all

238
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,583
and working together every day,

239
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:46,333
for the first time in my life,
I felt like I had another family.

240
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:53,416
That's why I wanted to stay
within that family circle.

241
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,250
That feeling wasn't a lie.

242
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,500
Thank you so much.

243
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,708
I'm truly grateful.

244
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,166
We may never meet again,

245
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,583
but I'll never forget you.

246
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,458
She's an employee with no family.
Please let me check if she's okay.

247
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:22,708
Understood.

248
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,916
Thank you.

249
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,583
She's been here…

250
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,583
alone, all this time.

251
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,291
When I went to the Koita Republic before,

252
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,375
I heard about a rare cacao
that could make the finest chocolate.

253
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:47,916
It was called "Godsend."

254
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,041
I thought maybe
the cacao Chef Kenji's holding here

255
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,458
is that very one.

256
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,333
They also call it "purple cacao."

257
00:24:58,833 --> 00:24:59,666
Well,

258
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,916
it’s hard to tell the color
from this photo.

259
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:20,875
I…

260
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,875
have feelings for someone.

261
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,916
But she always runs from me.

262
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,333
My mother…

263
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:39,791
was an alcoholic.

264
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,041
My father used to beat her every day.

265
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,250
She was a lightweight, but she drank
too much and became addicted.

266
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,541
When I was little,
she left me and disappeared.

267
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:59,625
I hated myself
for not being able to do anything.

268
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,500
And this person I like…

269
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,291
reminds me of my mother.

270
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,833
She's a different person when she's drunk,

271
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,708
but she's beautiful…

272
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,166
and has a heart of gold.

273
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,291
Lately…

274
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,416
I've been wondering

275
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,000
if I'm broken inside too.

276
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:32,875
Just like her.

277
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,125
But I've decided to let go of the past

278
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,750
and choose my own future properly.

279
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,125
Let's put an end to this.

280
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,708
I think it's for the best.

281
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:13,625
I'm sorry for everything.

282
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:29,666
What's this?

283
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:37,708
Hana probably went
to the Koita Republic to get cacao.

284
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,458
Go and bring her back.

285
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:43,250
Wait…

286
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:48,125
Why… me?

287
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,125
The other day…

288
00:27:56,916 --> 00:28:01,041
I saw you two kissing.

289
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,833
What? When?

290
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,000
A few days ago. Right here.

291
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,250
Seriously?

292
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,916
Irene…

293
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,666
A-Are you okay?

294
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,208
Hold on.

295
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:55,625
Oh.

296
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,500
I came to pick up my coat,

297
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,875
but you were drunk and asleep.

298
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,416
Sorry.

299
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:13,125
I drank too much.
I don't remember anything.

300
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,250
I'm sorry.

301
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,625
It's okay.

302
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,083
Instead of apologizing…

303
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:32,416
please tell her how you really feel.

304
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,375
You have to gather your courage

305
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,500
and express your feelings
to the person you like.

306
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:49,708
I'll also…

307
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,583
build up my courage…

308
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,291
and say it now.

309
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,291
I've always

310
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,500
been attracted to you.

311
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,583
T-To me?

312
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,458
You probably don't remember it.

313
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,250
When I almost
got into an accident outside here,

314
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,333
you saved me.

315
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:31,500
It's embarrassing, but ever since then,

316
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,916
I've wanted to see you.

317
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,166
I even took up kendo.

318
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:40,916
All by myself,

319
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,958
in my own world…

320
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:51,875
I went and fell for you.

321
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,333
I liked you.

322
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,791
Y-You liked me?

323
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,500
Thanks to you, I realized something.

324
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,333
What I'm feeling right now is gratitude.

325
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:20,416
Thank you so much for everything.

326
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,541
Um,

327
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,166
your eyes…

328
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,291
are always looking
for Sosuke, aren't they?

329
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,625
Feelings that grow so big
you can't hide them

330
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:46,666
are sometimes more obvious
to the people around you.

331
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,708
Also…

332
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:55,125
I don't think it was me

333
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,958
who saved you.

334
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:00,833
Huh?

335
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,708
That's dangerous.

336
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,541
TAKADA

337
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,875
Hello?

338
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,250
Yeah, I'm fine.

339
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,875
I'm almost there.

340
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,708
Remember when you brought me
new kendo gear on my birthday?

341
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,000
You said you saved someone that day.

342
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,291
Turns out that was Hana.

343
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,916
Are you guys idiots or what?

344
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:36,625
Huh?

345
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,916
I mean, you're the one Hana likes.

346
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,333
Me?

347
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah.

348
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:47,166
For a while now, actually.

349
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:39,375
Th-Thief!

350
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,916
Oh, no!

351
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,166
W-Wait.

352
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,875
I found it!

353
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:05,833
Hana!

354
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,708
How did you…?

355
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,375
Shh. You're safe now.

356
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,083
Are you hurt?

357
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,041
Why did you come here alone?

358
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:21,250
I just wanted to help
everyone at Le Sauveur.

359
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,916
There, there.

360
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,291
-Mr. Fujiwara!
-Huh?

361
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,875
Are you okay?

362
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,083
Are you all right?

363
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,166
What?

364
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,208
Hm?

365
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,333
Are you all right?

366
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,500
Why would you get hurt?

367
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,458
I was really worried, you know!

368
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:04,208
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

369
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,166
Oh, more importantly,

370
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,708
what did you just say?

371
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,750
Huh?

372
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:16,625
Did you say
you were really worried about me?

373
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:18,791
Well…

374
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,041
That's only natural!

375
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,666
You got hurt because of me.

376
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,833
Anyway,

377
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,750
why did you leave without telling me?

378
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,458
Don't disappear from my sight again.

379
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,000
I mean…

380
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,125
Uh…

381
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:52,333
As your boss, I was in trouble
when my employee suddenly disappeared.

382
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,708
But I'm not your employee anymore.

383
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:00,500
I see.

384
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,166
You're not my employee anymore.

385
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,416
Oh, but it's different
if you're the Anonymous Chocolatier.

386
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:15,041
I'm here on business too.

387
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:20,333
To ask the top chocolatier in Japan
with genius-level skills

388
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:26,166
to make the best chocolate
for the upcoming competition.

389
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:35,875
I'm Sosuke Fujiwara,
president of Le Sauveur.

390
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,958
Would you be the chocolatier
that represents Le Sauveur

391
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:43,708
and compete
in the World Chocolatier Masters?

392
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,333
Please.

393
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,583
Ow.

394
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,625
-A-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

395
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,750
For now, you seem hungry,
so let's get something to eat.

396
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,000
Yes.

397
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,083
I'm hungry.

398
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:32,291
This is delicious too.

399
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,875
Mm! What's this?

400
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,416
Whoa.

401
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,333
There's even more food.

402
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,791
I'm sorry about earlier.

403
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,250
I was only thinking about myself again.

404
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:58,833
I thought winning and proving ourselves
in the competition would save Le Sauveur.

405
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,458
No.

406
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:03,958
If I compete,

407
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:09,375
I might ruin everything instead.

408
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,083
Forget winning.

409
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:18,333
I might even run away.

410
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:23,083
That's why, for Le Sauveur's sake,

411
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,666
I had to find Godsend no matter what.

412
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:30,708
Even so,

413
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,375
who comes to a place like this alone?

414
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:38,291
Without being scared,
and with just one photo.

415
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,166
It's like you came looking for a miracle.

416
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,916
A miracle

417
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,666
is something that happens in the end.

418
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:55,208
I think that's why
the word "miracle" exists.

419
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:02,458
You meant it, right?

420
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:08,208
That you want to save Le Sauveur?

421
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,166
Yes.

422
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:20,833
Then let's find
that miracle together no matter what.

423
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,541
Yeah.

424
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:58,833
"Le Chocolat du Bonheur."

425
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,458
The Chocolate of Happiness.

426
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,500
The Chocolate of Happiness.

427
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:23,416
That old lady looked so happy
talking about Chef Kenji's chocolate.

428
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:24,875
Yes.

429
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,000
Slightly flawed and damaged fruit

430
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:31,916
was actually a gift from God.

431
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:34,875
Now that was the real miracle.

432
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:43,291
Even if I'm slightly flawed,

433
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,541
if you'll accept someone like me…

434
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,750
I'll enter the competition.

435
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,666
If it's to save the shop,
you don't have to push yourself.

436
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,583
No.

437
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:07,333
This isn't for anyone else. It's for me.

438
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:11,875
I don't want to hide anymore.

439
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm done running away.

440
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,791
Are you sure you'll be okay?

441
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,208
Of course

442
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,291
I won't be okay at all.

443
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,083
I want to be okay,

444
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:35,875
but that itself feels like a miracle.

445
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,208
"A miracle is something
that happens in the end."

446
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:46,833
"That's why the word 'miracle' exists."

447
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:49,000
Didn't someone say that?

448
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:55,875
Even if there's no miracle…

449
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,708
I'll be by your side.

450
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,916
Wherever you look, I'll be there.

451
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,208
Then…

452
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,166
I take up your offer.

453
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,458
Oh, um…

454
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:04,458
You said we don't need
to practice anymore.

455
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,166
Right.

456
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,208
We don't need any more practice.

457
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:11,625
So…

458
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:15,666
I'm going to build up my courage first.

459
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,625
This isn't practice.

460
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:23,500
It's sarang.

461
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,500
Sarang.

462
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:41,416
Huh?

463
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:12,708
Everyone, thank you
for all your hard work.

464
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,666
The day has finally come.

465
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:19,208
Our fund will buy up the company's shares,

466
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,166
and you'll take control of management.

467
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,791
I’ll repay you with large returns.

468
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,000
Please focus on buying them up.

469
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:32,333
Okay, everyone, let's keep everything
running smoothly until trading begins.

470
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:33,625
Yes, sir.

471
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,666
I see. Got it.

472
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:43,708
Well, it shouldn't be a big problem.

473
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:45,416
Yeah.

474
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,041
See you tomorrow.

475
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:14,000
