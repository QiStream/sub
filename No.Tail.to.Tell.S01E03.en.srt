1
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,961
NO TAIL TO TELL

2
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,129
Anyway…

3
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,172
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

4
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:48,882
…what's this?

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,467
Oh, that.

6
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,136
Hey, Woo-seok.

7
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,180
By any chance,

8
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,224
do you have a wish?

9
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,894
A wish?

10
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,942
Why? Are you going to grant it?

11
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,486
No, it's not that. Actually--

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,614
It's fine.
It's my life, so I'll handle it myself.

13
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,324
I should get going now, Si-yeol.

14
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,412
By the way…

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,586
Congrats on the contract renewal.

16
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,505
Hey…

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,236
- Hey, Yeon-su.
- Si-yeol, we've got a problem.

18
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,904
Now what?

19
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,573
What's all the fuss about?

20
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,283
Thames FC is facing relegation.

21
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,535
What on earth are you talking about?

22
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,622
Relegation? We won the league last season.

23
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,001
They're voiding last season's title,
stripping us of our Champions League spot,

24
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,253
and relegating us to the Championship.

25
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,214
Is it April Fools' Day?

26
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,716
I'm serious.

27
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,260
Apparently, Thames violated
Financial Fair Play regulations,

28
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,388
so UEFA just slapped them with sanctions.

29
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,854
Explain it in simple terms.

30
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,856
What exactly is "Financial Fair Play"?

31
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,399
It's a UEFA rule stating

32
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,779
that a club can't spend more than
a certain percentage of its revenue.

33
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,864
I still don't get it.

34
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,743
Basically, the club
committed accounting fraud

35
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,913
to cover your transfer fee
and massive salary.

36
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,334
So what am I supposed to do now?

37
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,628
Will you play in the second division?

38
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,922
Are you crazy? I'm Kang Si-yeol.

39
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,133
Then there's only one option left.

40
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,410
What the…

41
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,704
KANG SI-YEOL

42
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,415
THAMES FC REFUSES TRANSFER
KANG SI-YEOL FACES A MAJOR CRISIS

43
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,088
SECOND DIVISION NEXT FOR KANG SI-YEOL?

44
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,508
THAMES FC CHARGED
WITH VIOLATING FFP REGULATIONS

45
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268
This won't do.

46
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,771
Your passport's at home, right?

47
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,397
I'll have someone bring it over.

48
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,316
Let's head to the airport right now.

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,110
I don't think staying in Korea
will solve anything.

50
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,238
Okay, find the earliest flight
available right now.

51
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,121
What are you doing? Let's hurry.

52
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,540
Yeah, I'm coming.

53
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,128
NOVEMBER 20TH
ANNIVERSARY OF GRANDMA'S DEATH

54
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:03,470
DEACON KIM BOK-SUN
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

55
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,598
Ms. Kim.

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,938
It didn't look like Si-yeol would make it
again this year, so I came instead.

57
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,235
Gosh, you know how busy he is.

58
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,614
Still, seeing how he timed his return,

59
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,116
it seems like he really meant
to come this year.

60
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,578
But something came up,

61
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,914
so he's probably
out of the country right now.

62
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,138
Hey, you…

63
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,017
Grandma, I'm here.

64
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,234
Looks like Woo-seok's been coming
to see you, Grandma.

65
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,903
He won't even see me these days.

66
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,469
GARDEN OF PEACE MEMORIAL PARK

67
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,721
I know

68
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,266
you looked after my grandma for me,

69
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,770
visiting her every holiday
and taking her to the hospital.

70
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,025
That's because you were abroad.

71
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,904
You were there when she passed too.

72
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,408
And you've been bringing her flowers
every year on her anniversary.

73
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,536
Hey, why are you getting all sappy?

74
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,957
That's the kind of friend you are to me.

75
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,752
You can tell me anything, okay?

76
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,421
If you ever need help, I've got your back.

77
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,965
If you need money, I can give you--

78
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,343
That's why I'm avoiding you right now.

79
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,849
I don't want…

80
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,812
to ask you for favors
or borrow money from you.

81
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,232
I want us to stay friends.

82
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,902
Even if you're a Premier League player,

83
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,030
no matter how famous you are,

84
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,825
I want us to be friends for who we are.

85
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,997
But if I start asking you for things
or relying on you for help,

86
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,833
I wouldn't be able to see you
as a friend anymore.

87
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,798
- Woo-seok--
- Let's stop talking about this.

88
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,132
Just think of it

89
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,386
as giving me some space for now.

90
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,265
But seriously,

91
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,185
is it really okay for you to be here?

92
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,857
Actually, my agent's already in the UK.

93
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,319
I said I'd stop by my grandma's grave,
then head there right away.

94
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,114
Do you think things will work out?

95
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,367
It doesn't look good right now.

96
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,495
The only option is to meet
and convince them,

97
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,541
but neither the chairman
nor the coach will see my agent.

98
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,256
Jeez, another reporter.

99
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,716
I'd better go.

100
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,884
I should go see what I can do.

101
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,969
Hey, wait.

102
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,471
You dropped this.

103
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,765
What is this?

104
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,808
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

105
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,727
Are you into this kind of stuff lately?

106
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,645
Isn't this like a cult or something?

107
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,647
Oh, right.

108
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,777
Woo-seok.

109
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,114
I think…

110
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,534
there might be a way.

111
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,627
The player is determined to transfer.

112
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,422
But Thames FC is refusing
to negotiate at all.

113
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,050
We offered
a 180 million euro transfer fee,

114
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,845
but they reiterated
that he isn't for sale.

115
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,436
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

116
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,272
Hey, what are you doing? That's dangerous.

117
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,526
I'm pretty sure
this is how I was told to do it.

118
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,869
Are you okay?

119
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,205
Why isn't it working?

120
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,652
You summoned me sooner
than I expected, Si-yeol.

121
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,988
Then again, the more humans have,

122
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,534
the greedier they get,
and the bigger their worries become.

123
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,121
That's why they always end up
needing beings like me.

124
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,500
So, tell me.

125
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,086
What's this great wish of yours?

126
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,687
EPISODE 3
THE RISE AND FALL

127
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,525
THAMES FC, LONDON, UK

128
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,578
That's none of your business.

129
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,292
I heard there's a nice pub nearby.

130
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,170
If you're done for the day,
why don't you stop by?

131
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,028
I couldn't even get him to see me,

132
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,739
and now I just run into him here?

133
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,425
So,

134
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,222
the real reason the Geumsu Group heir
turned himself in nine years ago

135
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,974
was because of that person… I mean…

136
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,059
Nine-tailed fox.

137
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,435
Right.

138
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,772
It was because of that nine-tailed fox?

139
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,024
Yeah.

140
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,986
I can't believe it,
but I can't say I don't believe it either.

141
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,490
But still,

142
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,576
she said she'd grant your wish,
and that's it?

143
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,037
She just listened and disappeared.

144
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,873
I know.
I'm not sure what's going on either.

145
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,378
RECENT WITHDRAWALS

146
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,088
What the…

147
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,674
What is it?

148
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,301
Did she really fix things?

149
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,221
No, but money was taken out of my account.

150
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,098
Out of the blue? How much?

151
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,059
- One hundred million won.
- What?

152
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,398
What the hell?

153
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,609
Hey, is your account
still getting drained?

154
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,112
Could it be a phone scam?

155
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,539
Hello?

156
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,251
Si-yeol, it's all settled.
You're clear for the transfer.

157
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,836
Really?

158
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,590
Yeah. I just ran into the chairman,
and it was like he was possessed.

159
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:23,136
He agreed to your transfer
and wants to know your preferred team.

160
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,763
He said he'll give
your negotiations top priority.

161
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,772
What did she say?

162
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,650
So can you transfer?

163
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,948
Really?

164
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,493
It's settled? Just like that?

165
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,245
Yeah.

166
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,789
Just like that.

167
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,847
- Hey, that's Kang Si-yeol.
- Hello.

168
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,973
Hello.

169
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,526
Si-yeol!

170
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,281
Hey, Woo-seok.

171
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,368
What are you doing here?

172
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,705
Si-yeol, can I really

173
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,417
ask you for a favor?

174
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,628
Of course.

175
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,840
The truth is,
I don't want to quit like this.

176
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,968
I want to play professionally,

177
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,555
and I want to play
for the national team too.

178
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,891
I really want

179
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,269
to live my life differently, just once.

180
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,772
Do you think…

181
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,483
that if I made a wish like you did,

182
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,985
it could come true?

183
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,118
I don't think so.

184
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,285
Why not?

185
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,414
Wishes always come with a price.

186
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,583
The bigger the wish,
the greater the price.

187
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,919
But your friend here

188
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,380
has nothing to offer.

189
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:28,094
Does that price have to be money?

190
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,806
What, are you thinking
of offering up your soul?

191
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,896
If that's what it takes, then yes.

192
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,315
Really? What use would that be to me?

193
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,527
Typical humans.

194
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,696
Always falling for tired clichés.

195
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,365
Is there really no other way?

196
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,702
I'll do whatever it takes.

197
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,373
You clearly have this all wrong.

198
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,794
You're not qualified to be my client.
Do you understand?

199
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,007
That means that you have nothing
of any value to me.

200
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,425
And you.

201
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,760
You think I'm a charity or something?

202
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,097
Don't ever summon me
for something this petty.

203
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,224
How insolent.

204
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,395
Don't go. We're not finished yet.

205
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,696
What?

206
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,990
You talk a big game,

207
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,618
but it all comes down to money in the end.

208
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,495
What are you getting at?

209
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,414
I'll pay for him.
That should settle it, right?

210
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,001
- No.
- Why not?

211
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,671
You have to pay the price
for your own wish.

212
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,800
But if you pay for him,
you're basically giving him your wish.

213
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,135
What's wrong with that?

214
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,555
What's wrong is that it's a good deed.

215
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,101
Maybe I forgot to tell you,
but I have only one principle.

216
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,688
I avoid doing even the smallest good deed
and only avoid doing major misdeeds.

217
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,234
I'd hate to cultivate more virtue
and end up becoming human.

218
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,862
Come on, stop making excuses.

219
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,407
- Excuses?
- That sure sounds like one.

220
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,327
You came to me first
to help catch that hit-and-run driver.

221
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,329
If that's not a good deed, then what is?

222
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,249
You know,
I think you'll need to make a wish.

223
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,294
Wish for it. I'll grant it for you.

224
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,338
What kind of principle is that, anyway?

225
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,799
Well, that was--

226
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,468
Just do it.
Unless it's beyond your capability.

227
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,140
"Beyond my capability"?

228
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:46,941
Come to think of it,
our first meeting was way too friendly.

229
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,319
That's why you're being so reckless
and pushing your luck.

230
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,617
Fine. I'll grant the wish.

231
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,246
But how I choose to grant it is up to me.

232
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,206
And of course, you'll pay the price.

233
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,417
Any problems with that?

234
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,603
I AM KANG SI-YEOL

235
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,221
Ladies and gentlemen.

236
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,765
We are experiencing sudden turbulence.

237
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:47,019
All passengers, please remain seated
until further notice.

238
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,394
DRIVEN BY YOUR TRUST
BEYOND SATISFACTION

239
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,702
Wake up, you bastard!

240
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,291
Hey!

241
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,971
What the…

242
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,397
Where am I?

243
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,881
FOREVER CARE NURSING HOME

244
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,216
What is this?

245
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,765
Did you sleep well, Si-yeol?

246
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,976
What's going on right now?

247
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,771
What happened?

248
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,939
Why am I suddenly here?

249
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,025
You made a wish, so a price must be paid.

250
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:58,984
What?

251
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,862
Wait, what does Woo-seok's wish
have to do--

252
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,489
Didn't I tell you?

253
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,117
I can grant the wish,
but how I do it is up to me.

254
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,578
Once again, your wish has been granted.

255
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,003
What do you mean,
my wish has been granted?

256
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,130
Where is Woo-seok right now?

257
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,186
What?

258
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,234
What the…

259
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,362
Here.

260
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,073
You dropped this, Mr. Hyeon.

261
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,324
Oh, I see.

262
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,911
But how do you know my name?

263
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:51,996
Of course I know you.

264
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,125
Everyone in Korea knows who you are.

265
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,251
Right.

266
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,294
Wait, what?

267
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,462
What do you mean…

268
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,798
Excuse me?

269
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,054
What is this?

270
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,310
"Hyeon Woo-seok."

271
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,312
Why am I…

272
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,992
Fine. I'll grant the wish.

273
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,454
But how I choose to grant it is up to me.

274
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,460
Well, let's see.

275
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,713
Your friend is probably
where you're supposed to be right now.

276
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,133
Oh, come on.

277
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,179
Stop talking in riddles.
You're not making any sense.

278
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:55,184
What does Woo-seok's wish have to do
with me being here?

279
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,604
I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

280
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,731
That's understandable.

281
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,691
But you know…

282
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,906
I'm a bit busy right now.

283
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,366
I have another client waiting.

284
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,410
Sadly, I don't have the time
to explain everything.

285
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:16,038
Are you kidding me? I was on a plane to--

286
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,000
You'll understand exactly
what's going on soon enough.

287
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,545
So, we'll finish this later.

288
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,509
Jeez, what now?

289
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,261
Wait.

290
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,097
Where'd she go?

291
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,684
Seriously?

292
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,980
Hey, Si-yeol. I know you're in there!

293
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,481
Si-yeol, open the door.

294
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,317
- Si-yeol!
- What the hell?

295
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,819
I know you're in there.

296
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,446
- Open the door, Si-yeol.
- Si-yeol!

297
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,658
See, I told you he was here.

298
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,744
- Open the door already. Jeez.
- What took you so long?

299
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:59,039
Hey, have you been drinking?

300
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,541
- What?
- No way.

301
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,292
You know Si-yeol doesn't drink.

302
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,711
He's really disciplined.

303
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,296
Look. There are empty bottles everywhere.

304
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,675
This place is a mess.

305
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,094
He must've been having a rough time.

306
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,846
Hey.

307
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,057
This is why I told you
not to let soccer consume your life.

308
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,268
Who are you people? What is this?

309
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,853
Do we know each other?

310
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,480
Of course, and that's exactly why
we're here to pick you up.

311
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,982
I've got all his things.

312
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,151
Good. Let's go now.

313
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,237
Go where? I'm not going anywhere!

314
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,905
Who the hell are you guys?

315
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,368
Why won't anyone
give me a straight answer?

316
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,955
Si-yeol, come on. Let's go.
Just apologize to the coach.

317
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,167
Apologize for what? To whom?

318
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,004
Just apologize.

319
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,756
You're such a hothead.

320
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,549
Lift him up.

321
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,925
- One, two, three!
- Wait, hold on!

322
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,386
- Let's go.
- Let go of me! I said let go!

323
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,722
Let go. Stop it!

324
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,141
Hey, that hurts! Let me go!

325
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,559
I'm not going anywhere!

326
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,487
Hey.

327
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,283
Welcome.

328
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,871
I was wondering who it was.
It's been a while.

329
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,629
I had this specially ordered
from the hotel patisserie.

330
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,217
They say this is all the rage
with young people these days.

331
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,886
I hope you like it.

332
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,013
Gosh, you didn't have to bring anything,

333
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,100
especially considering
how much you brought.

334
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,563
Not bad.

335
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,276
This is why I like familiar faces.

336
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,447
It's just a shame
they keep dying of old age.

337
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,784
I hope you live a long life, Chairman Kim.

338
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,122
I guess you were taming a new client.

339
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,248
Yes.

340
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,043
This client is clueless and rude,

341
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,629
so I'm taking extra care
to tame him properly.

342
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,552
I like the scent.

343
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,519
That fellow must be suffering quite a bit.

344
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,481
- My gosh.
- Anyway, Chairman Kim.

345
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,984
You've lived a long life
and have everything.

346
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,569
And yet, you want more?

347
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,280
You've grown greedy with age.

348
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,869
Actually,

349
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,999
I didn't come to see you
because I have a wish.

350
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,085
You didn't?

351
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,921
Then what do you want from me?

352
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,266
Seriously.

353
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,604
Who are you guys?
I've asked you so many times.

354
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,023
What's with you today?

355
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,608
Knock it off, already.

356
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,818
You fought with the coach, not us.

357
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,821
You can't just dump us
like a bad investment.

358
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,532
You're not really quitting soccer
like this, are you?

359
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,993
What are you talking about?
Why would I quit?

360
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,204
I'm Kang Si-yeol.

361
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,247
I know you're Kang Si-yeol.

362
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,249
That's why we came to pick you up.

363
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,793
What does he think he is, royalty?

364
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,838
You'd never see a player
throw a water bottle at their coach,

365
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,506
even in the Premier League.

366
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,800
He didn't actually throw it at the coach.

367
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,761
He threw it nearby,

368
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,347
but it just bounced off the wall
and hit him, right?

369
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,681
No way.

370
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,642
When this jerk threw the bottle
at the coach,

371
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,518
I saw it in his eyes. He lost it.

372
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,103
He was aiming right at him.

373
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,648
Come on, Si-yeol isn't that crazy.

374
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,942
Hey! He is crazy!

375
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,902
This is driving me crazy.

376
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,362
Hey.

377
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,906
Are you guys on the national team?

378
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,493
I've never even seen any of you before.

379
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,829
Did Coach Gonzalez tell you
to bring me in?

380
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,168
Wow, I think he really has gone crazy.

381
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,671
- Si-yeol.
- I told you he's crazy.

382
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,964
Whatever, forget it.

383
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,216
Whoever you are,
I need to get to London now.

384
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,219
- So take me to the airport.
- London? Why?

385
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,305
Jeez, don't you guys even watch the news?

386
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,975
I'm in the middle
of transfer negotiations.

387
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,017
Really?

388
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,146
And where exactly are you transferring to?

389
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,731
To a Sunday league team?

390
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,025
Hey, Beom, that's a bit harsh.

391
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,403
Si-yeol,
don't let your pride get in the way.

392
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,571
Just go to the coach
and beg for forgiveness.

393
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,615
- Jeez!
- Seriously!

394
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:48,245
Who am I even supposed to beg,
and for what?

395
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,039
- Oh, come on!
- Just beg.

396
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,916
- Who am I supposed to beg?
- Knock it off.

397
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,960
- I'm getting out!
- Hold on tight!

398
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,211
- Stay still!
- Hold on to him!

399
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,737
Last night,

400
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,073
the wooden-handled dagger
that was here disappeared.

401
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:32,372
I remembered you'd come by
from time to time and just stare at it.

402
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,834
I felt it was only right to let you know.

403
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,338
There's a story behind this object,
isn't there?

404
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,257
Yes, there is.

405
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,136
Do you have a family, Chairman Kim?

406
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,431
Yes, I have a wife and children.

407
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,559
I had an older sister.

408
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,354
We weren't related by blood, but…

409
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,862
Grandma.

410
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,159
We spent a thousand years together,
cultivating ourselves.

411
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,744
We were like family.

412
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,080
Be happy, Geum-ho.

413
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,457
My lady!

414
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,544
My lady, something terrible has happened!

415
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,837
There are people outside--

416
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,215
Open the gates at once!

417
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,467
- Oh no!
- Oh my!

418
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,010
This is the house of a traitor!

419
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,471
Capture every single one of them!

420
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,728
That way!

421
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,405
Chun-sim!

422
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,696
I can't let you in.

423
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,992
The swordsmith is occupied at the moment.

424
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,327
If you have business at the forge,
try somewhere else.

425
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,246
What are you planning to do?

426
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,748
Are you forging the Sajin Ritual Blade?

427
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,792
What are you planning to use it for?

428
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,337
I guess I came to the right place, then.

429
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,298
You ignored me when I asked for your help

430
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,050
even though I told you
I saw a miserable future for Geum-ho.

431
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,595
But look, you chased me down like this.

432
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,221
It's a human life.

433
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,308
A life that Geum-ho
has to endure on her own.

434
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,144
This isn't something you should meddle in.

435
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,645
Don't make me laugh.

436
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,315
It's been a thousand years.

437
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,234
She spent a thousand years
cultivating herself and doing good deeds.

438
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,778
Is it right for the human life
she was rewarded with

439
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,032
to be nothing but misery and misfortune?

440
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,201
Is that Heaven's so-called will?

441
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,411
So making her commit a sin

442
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,039
and undoing a thousand years
of spiritual training

443
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,999
was the solution you came up with?

444
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:25,837
Yes. Her family was branded as traitors
and condemned to live as slaves.

445
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,048
Her husband will be beaten to death,

446
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,425
and her children will starve,
sicken, and die.

447
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,762
And she will grow old
having to watch it all happen.

448
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,598
Anything would be better than that.

449
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,709
Geum-ho.

450
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,173
THE SAJIN RITUAL BLADE

451
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,635
Stab him with this. You have to.

452
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,180
- "Him"?
- I'm talking about your husband.

453
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,433
You're not happy at all living as a human.

454
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,643
You're miserable.

455
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,477
If you kill the one you love
with that dagger,

456
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,606
they say you can return
to being a nine-tailed fox.

457
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,652
Eun-ho.

458
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,533
I have a wish. Could you grant it for me?

459
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,868
Of course. What is it?

460
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,415
Promise me that you'll grant it.

461
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,376
Very well. Go on.

462
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,421
Don't ever

463
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,174
appear before me again.

464
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,304
That dagger

465
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,099
was the last thing I gave Geum-ho.

466
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:06,813
It's also one of the very few
sacred objects that can kill me.

467
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,741
DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC
FIRST HOME GAME OF THE SEASON

468
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,286
- Jeez.
- Damn it.

469
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,204
Hurry up!

470
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,166
- Who is it?
- Good afternoon, Coach.

471
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,542
Wait, why should I beg…

472
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,377
K4 LEAGUE DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC
EMBLEM CONTEST

473
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,379
Just stay in here already! Damn it!

474
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,464
Wait…

475
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,925
DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC

476
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,802
For crying out loud.

477
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,475
What do you want?

478
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,269
Hey, Yong-gil!

479
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,855
"Yong-gil"?

480
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,732
What are you doing here? And…

481
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,651
A black eye…

482
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,277
"Black eye"?

483
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,405
Where's Coach Gonzalez?

484
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,119
Why on earth

485
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,289
are you looking
for the national team coach?

486
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,291
I don't know. You tell me.

487
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,044
A bunch of weirdos showed up earlier

488
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,255
and kept telling me
to apologize to the coach.

489
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,968
So you're saying the coach
you need to apologize to

490
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,639
is Gonzalez and not me?

491
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,600
What are you talking about?
Why would I apologize to you?

492
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,812
Where even am I?

493
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,234
Hey, Yong-gil,

494
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,946
it's been a while. Aren't you
even going to offer me some coffee?

495
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,366
This little…

496
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,869
He's lost his mind.

497
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,747
Listen, Si-yeol.

498
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,210
What do you think you're doing?
Is this some kind of protest?

499
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,005
What's your problem?
Is this because I called you by name?

500
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,132
Don't you remember?

501
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,467
You said I could call you
by your name and not "Coach."

502
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,593
Hey!

503
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,721
Why are you yelling at me?

504
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,598
Why would

505
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,186
a fourth-division player like you
be looking for the national team coach?

506
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,896
"Fourth division"?

507
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,649
Me?

508
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,651
But I'm Kang Si-yeol.

509
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,239
I was ready to give you a second chance

510
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,534
if you came here
and begged for forgiveness.

511
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,620
But never mind. You're off the team!

512
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,374
This is ridiculous.

513
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,169
Anyone would think you were my coach.

514
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,172
Fine, kick me off the team!

515
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,593
Fine, you… No. You know what?

516
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,013
I'm going to ban you
from the sport, you punk!

517
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,433
You? Ban me? There's no way.

518
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,185
Do whatever you want!

519
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,854
Kick me off the team. Ban me for life.

520
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,481
Do whatever you want!

521
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,358
That black eye
really knocked something loose.

522
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,570
Unbelievable!

523
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,197
What's wrong with him?

524
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,948
That little…

525
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,915
- Hey, did you apologize?
- Did he say you can return to training?

526
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,958
You didn't cause more trouble, did you?

527
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,588
Be honest with me.

528
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,424
Is this a hidden camera prank?

529
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,802
What?

530
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,513
This is for YouTube, right?

531
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,015
Whose channel is it?

532
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,185
You shouldn't be doing this
just for views. I'm Kang Si-yeol.

533
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,855
What's with him today?

534
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:39,943
You can't do this.

535
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,821
Even if you're desperate for views,
you need to ask first.

536
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,002
- I'm borrowing this.
- Wait…

537
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,548
- What…
- What's going on?

538
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,392
It wasn't just the cameras.

539
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,186
The whole security system
went down briefly.

540
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,023
Do you have any idea
what might have happened?

541
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,900
It doesn't make any sense, sir.

542
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,903
Everything was normal
during our last patrol.

543
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,030
Looks like your memory was erased.

544
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,283
Pardon?

545
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,494
You really didn't notice anything unusual?

546
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,539
No, ma'am. We patrol in pairs--

547
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,332
Look me in the eye.

548
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,670
Are you sure you didn't notice
anything unusual?

549
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,631
Well…

550
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,593
Actually, there was someone.

551
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,179
It was a man.

552
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,807
- Sir!
- Stay out of this.

553
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,685
A man?

554
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:57,896
Was he alone?

555
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:03,234
Yes. I tried to stop him
and asked how he got in--

556
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,250
He's under a binding spell.

557
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,604
I didn't realize there were still humans
who could use techniques like that.

558
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,647
A human?

559
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,816
Can a human do such a thing?

560
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,527
It's not something just anyone can do.

561
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,448
A mere human
mimicking the powers of a deity

562
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,576
will pay a steep price.

563
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,831
Why would someone like that
need the wooden-handled dagger?

564
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,126
Could they be…

565
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,172
trying to harm you?

566
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,678
Do you really think a human
who's learned a few cheap tricks like this

567
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,596
could actually harm me?

568
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,018
Sure, I'd die if I were stabbed.
But how would he even do that?

569
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,312
I'd like to see him try.

570
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,480
That's a relief then.

571
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,941
So what should we do?

572
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,860
I'm not sure.

573
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,198
But let me take a look at him first.

574
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,374
ADVANCING CORRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE

575
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,876
HUMAN-CENTERED CORRECTIONS
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

576
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,398
It's been a while.

577
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,317
Seeing you out here,

578
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,903
you look like a different person.

579
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,868
TWO YEARS AGO

580
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,045
There's no need to search
this cell so thoroughly.

581
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,214
- Excuse me?
- Jeez, come with me.

582
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,431
Inmate 478, anything to report?

583
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:49,275
Inmate 133 has
cigarettes stashed in his cell.

584
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,070
Inmate 2759 is making flower cards
out of cardboard.

585
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,739
And as for Inmate 1614…

586
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,118
You little piece of shit!

587
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,954
- You little bastard!
- Why did this jerk end up in our cell?

588
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:02,955
Damn it!

589
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,712
You crazy bastard.

590
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,215
Hey, I heard your father disowned you.

591
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,884
You're nothing now, you piece of shit.

592
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,388
Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you.

593
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,016
- I should poke your eyes out!
- That's enough.

594
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,812
What did you just say, old man?

595
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,191
Hey, you just got here,
so you clearly don't know how things work.

596
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,945
- Mind your own damn business.
- I said, that's enough.

597
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,950
I've got business with this guy.

598
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,328
Is he out of his mind?

599
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,541
What's going on?

600
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,713
What the…

601
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,057
We need to talk.

602
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,684
Who the hell are you?

603
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,354
It's a bit cramped in here.
Why don't we go for a walk?

604
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,713
So you're not human either?

605
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,007
I'm human.

606
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,303
That doesn't make sense. How…

607
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,929
How could a human…

608
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,141
Why wouldn't a human
be able to do what a mere fox can do?

609
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,143
It's just a little tricky, that's all.

610
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,609
Take this.

611
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,611
What is it?

612
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,487
A warding sigil.

613
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,823
It's a talisman to ward off evil.

614
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,451
As long as you have this on you,

615
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,913
the nine-tailed fox's spell
won't affect you.

616
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,650
No need to thank me.

617
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,653
But when you get out,

618
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,947
let's do a job together.

619
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,339
Jeez.

620
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,008
Where are we going?

621
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,426
I told you before.

622
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,179
I said let's do a job together
once you get out.

623
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,640
What exactly is this "job"?

624
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,809
It's nothing difficult.

625
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,187
You just need to act as bait.

626
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,065
- What?
- Starting now,

627
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,485
I'm going on a fox hunt.

628
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:33,457
JOSEON-ERA INK-WASH PAINTING
DEPICTING COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY

629
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,085
You there, painter.

630
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,796
I was thinking of commissioning something.

631
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:43,384
I don't have anything to offer,
but I can buy you a drink.

632
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,059
I heard someone took the dagger
from over there last night.

633
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,895
Could you do a quick sketch of him for me?

634
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,412
Why isn't Woo-seok picking up?

635
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,313
I don't think you're a resident here.

636
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,733
Oh, it's me.

637
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,695
I've never seen you before.
Which unit are you visiting?

638
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,615
- Pardon?
- What?

639
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,408
Come on now.

640
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,627
What?

641
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,304
Who are you?

642
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:13,182
I'm sorry. I thought this was my home.

643
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:18,270
Wait, this is my home.

644
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,647
What a weirdo.

645
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,273
Oh my goodness!

646
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,441
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

647
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,068
Who are you? Why are you in my--

648
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,195
What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?

649
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,488
Excuse me.

650
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,365
- Sir, this woman--
- Sir, this man--

651
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,492
This guy's really asking for trouble.

652
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,578
- Who are you?
- What's wrong with you?

653
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,081
Don't you recognize me?

654
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,251
How on earth would I know who you are?

655
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,128
- Come on, get out.
- Wait a second!

656
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,671
That's enough. Out!

657
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,089
Wait…

658
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,717
Oh my goodness!

659
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:50,553
What's going on?

660
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,512
Excuse me!

661
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,972
- This is my home.
- Do something!

662
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,306
- Yes, ma'am.
- My gosh!

663
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,016
- Excuse me.
- This really is my home.

664
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,184
He's just…

665
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,894
This isn't possible.

666
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,229
What's wrong with him? Hey!

667
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,523
- Are you out of your mind?
- Oh my!

668
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,608
No, this seriously isn't possible.

669
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,069
Come on! I told you to get out!

670
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,572
I'm very sorry about this.

671
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,198
Come on, let's go!

672
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,131
What is all this?

673
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,883
It's a trap.

674
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,719
I told you, I'm going on a fox hunt.

675
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,889
You can catch a nine-tailed fox with this?

676
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,224
All you have to do is set the right bait.

677
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,060
A wicked creature like that

678
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,481
can never escape
once it's trapped in this sacred rope.

679
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,112
Why are you doing all this?

680
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,949
Do you have a grudge
against the nine-tailed fox too?

681
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,287
A hunter doesn't hunt
because of a personal grudge.

682
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,492
What are you doing?

683
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,579
Shut your mouth and stay still.
We don't want to jinx it.

684
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:06,564
What is this?

685
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:22,538
You.

686
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,417
Food's here. Go on and stuff your face!

687
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,886
What is that?

688
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,557
It's the vengeful spirit
of a starved wild dog.

689
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,726
What?

690
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,854
- Roll up your sleeve.
- Pardon?

691
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,150
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Roll it up.

692
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,527
Damn it.

693
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,073
Stay still.

694
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,792
That dog needs to pick up
the fox scent all over you.

695
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,962
The protective talisman you have
masks the fox's scent.

696
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,592
If you're done stuffing your face,
it's time to earn your keep.

697
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,803
This guy is under the fox's spell.

698
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,682
Don't move a muscle
unless you want to be torn to pieces.

699
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,603
Here.

700
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:33,317
Now, go and find out where that fox is.

701
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,884
SOLLENFORD AIRPORT, LONDON, UK

702
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,478
ONLY WOO-SEOK!

703
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,729
LOVE YOU FOREVER
WOO-SEOK

704
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,405
Woo-seok.

705
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,534
Dad?

706
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,704
Why are you here, Dad?

707
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,414
What do you mean?

708
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,084
Where else would I be?

709
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,005
I see.

710
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:38,882
Right.

711
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,760
Wait, listen to me. I'm not some weirdo.

712
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,013
I'm telling you that really is my home.

713
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,015
Hey, wait…

714
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,394
But do you seriously not know me?
Don't you watch soccer?

715
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,147
Don't you know Kang Si-yeol,
the world's best athlete?

716
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,277
What did you do
to get yourself thrown in here already?

717
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,361
You!

718
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,363
Perfect timing. Hold on a moment.

719
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,700
- Hey, you.
- Yes?

720
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,425
Find someone who looks like this.

721
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,510
Use any means necessary.

722
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,180
Yes, ma'am.

723
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,867
Do you understand what's going on now?

724
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,745
Damn it.

725
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,792
What did you do to me?

726
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,377
I guess not yet.

727
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,007
All right. I'll fill you in now.

728
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,888
I switched your fates.

729
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:11,767
What?

730
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,479
So, in this world,
the Kang Si-yeol you knew is gone.

731
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,564
Because your fate has changed.

732
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,900
Just tell me what's going on!

733
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:25,280
What does no one recognizing me
have to do with Woo-seok's wish?

734
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,573
And what happened to my house?

735
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,868
That's the price you paid
for your friend's wish.

736
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,707
For every rise, there must be a fall.

737
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,585
For someone to take the throne,

738
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,838
someone else
must be stripped of their crown.

739
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,257
That's the law of the world.

740
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,300
Not even I can change that.

741
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,345
So,

742
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,098
when you say
our fates have been switched…

743
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,059
Since someone became
a world-class soccer player,

744
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,439
someone else had to step down.

745
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,318
That's the only way
to maintain the balance.

746
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:19,877
Then…

747
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,089
it wasn't just a dream?

748
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,465
The past was rewritten.

749
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,093
Naturally, the present followed suit.

750
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,887
No way in hell.

751
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,806
So I really am a fourth-division player?

752
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,516
Are you kidding me? You…

753
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,311
What's the problem?

754
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,771
I made your friend a world-class player

755
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,983
who plays in the European leagues
and for the national team.

756
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,986
Isn't that enough?
That's what you both wished for.

757
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,907
"Enough"? The hell it is! I'm literally…

758
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,919
Whatever. Just put everything back
the way it was. Right now.

759
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,756
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

760
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:10,552
Because you have nothing left
to pay for a wish.

761
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:14,056
You have no money,
and the life you built is gone.

762
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,766
Then…

763
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,561
I have to keep living like this?

764
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,483
Well, there is a way.

765
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:26,526
What is it?

766
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,078
What's going on?

767
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,247
This is my place in London.

768
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,167
Gosh.

769
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,715
This is our house? For real?

770
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,969
- Woo-seok.
- Oh gosh.

771
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,929
What has he been going on about?

772
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,305
Of course this is our house.

773
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,290
It's simple.

774
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,712
All your friend needs to do
is make a wish, just like you did.

775
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,922
A wish to switch your fates back.

776
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:30,799
What?

777
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,426
Woo-seok.

778
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,553
Have you thought about it?

779
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,557
About what?

780
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,018
Your transfer. Where do you want to go?

781
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,855
They said they'll match
any contract terms we want.

782
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:46,690
So,

783
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,735
you just have to make the final call.

784
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,127
I can go…

785
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,881
anywhere I want?

786
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,676
Of course, you're Hyeon Woo-seok.

787
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,847
But I wonder

788
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:21,975
if your friend
would actually make that wish?

789
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,435
For your sake?

790
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:30,150
He finally has the life
he's always dreamed of.

791
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,360
He's only just started living it.

792
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,084
Why…

793
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,379
are you doing this to me?

794
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:56,134
I can't stand humans
who get cocky with me.

795
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,179
To be my client,

796
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,390
I needed to teach you some manners first.

797
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:04,976
That's it?

798
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:10,315
Do you think it's okay
to toy with people's lives like this?

799
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,359
Why are you getting so worked up?

800
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,946
Everything can be easily fixed
if your friend makes the wish.

801
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,451
What's wrong?
You don't trust your friend either?

802
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,583
Actually, I'm curious too.

803
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:33,338
Let's see how your friend
decides to play this.

804
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,759
NO TAIL TO TELL

805
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,929
Si-yeol, just one month.
Let's switch back in a month.

806
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,639
Hyeon Woo-seok! Oh, come on!

807
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,224
No, no.

808
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,476
Are you saying
I have to keep living like this?

809
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,855
I'm going to burn this place down!
Put me down!

810
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,149
I can't live like that. I won't, damn it!

811
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,400
Have you learned your lesson?

812
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,528
Put me back! Please.

813
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,698
Well, that should do it.
I guess I've tamed you enough.

814
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,741
Shall we end this here?

815
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,451
Is it good?

816
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,577
Where to?

817
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,412
I'm sorry. I thought this was a taxi.

818
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,998
You have the wish-granting
business card, don't you?

819
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,375
I have some business with that fox.

820
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,169
Get up, Kang Si-yeol.

821
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,632
