00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:15,974
1970, TOKYO, JAPAN

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:23,606
Take
the first flight out to Fukuoka tomorrow.

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,318
When you get there,
someone will be waiting for you.

4
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,657
And who would that be?

5
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,370
I want you to meet Ikeda Yuji
and hand over this briefcase.

6
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,129
Ikeda Yuji?

7
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,882
Your business partner.

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,219
The moment you
fall out of favor with Ikeda,

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,513
the deal's over.

10
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,440
EPISODE 1: A BUSINESSMAN

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,782
<i>My name is Matsuda Kenji,</i>

12
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>a businessman on a work trip to Fukuoka.</i>

13
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>My job is to deliver this briefcase safely
to Ikeda Yuji.</i>

14
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,969
Hey, are you not feeling well?

15
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,763
Are you scared to fly?

16
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,890
I'm not scared.

17
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,267
It's just my first time.

18
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,355
Everyone feels that way
their first time flying.

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,276
During takeoff,
your ears might pop a little.

20
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,988
It helps if you chew gum.

21
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,660
What do you say?

22
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,245
Thank you.

23
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,831
Good for you.

24
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,337
<i>Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen. This flight is scheduled…</i>

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,257
Japan Airways 351 cleared for takeoff.

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,633
Runway 33.

27
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,717
Stabilized.

28
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,053
<i>…and arrive at Fukuoka Itazuke Airport</i>

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>at around 8:50 a.m.</i>

30
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,722
<i>We will be taking off shortly.</i>

31
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:24,060
<i>Please be seated
and fasten your seat belt.</i>

32
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,854
<i>We will be taking off shortly.</i>

33
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:30,358
<i>Please be seated
and fasten your seat belt.</i>

34
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,903
Set takeoff thrust.

35
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,155
Set takeoff thrust.

36
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,781
Thrust set.

37
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,907
Check.

38
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,757
Japan Airways 351, Haneda departure.

39
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,595
Contact Tokyo Control 134.1.

40
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,096
Good day.

41
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,935
Sure.

42
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,776
Would you like something to drink?

43
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,945
- Cola, please.
- Sure.

44
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,742
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

45
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,077
Oh, excuse me.

46
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,417
Would you like something to drink?

47
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,076
Good morning.

48
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,668
Nobody move!

49
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,419
Don't move!

50
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,797
Move!

51
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,840
Don't move, or you're dead!

52
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,260
Don't move!

53
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,429
Mayday, mayday,
hijacking, hijacking.

54
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,014
- This is Japan Air…
- Stop.

55
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,309
We're the Revolutionary Army
of the Communist League.

56
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,727
Please don't kill me! Please!

57
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,479
Shut up and keep your heads down!

58
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,731
Heads down!

59
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,527
We're going to North Korea.

60
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,862
- Shut up!
- Hey!

61
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,281
Mom.

62
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,492
Are we going to die?

63
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,037
Shut up!

64
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,122
It's okay.

65
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,750
You and your mom
will make it out of here safely.

66
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,921
Shut up!

67
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>Japan Airways Flight 351,</i>

68
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:03,594
<i>a Japanese airliner that
left Tokyo Haneda Airport for Fukuoka</i>

69
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,056
<i>with 138 passengers and crew on board,
was hijacked midair.</i>

70
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,893
<i>The hijackers were the Revolutionary Army,</i>

71
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,354
<i>a radical leftist offshoot
of the Japanese Communist League,</i>

72
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,481
<i>calling themselves
the "Army for Revolutionary War."</i>

73
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>They returned to Japan
after military training in North Korea,</i>

74
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>and hijacked a civilian airliner,
intent on launching a revolutionary war.</i>

75
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,909
Heads down! Down!

76
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,635
MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, JAPAN

77
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,391
URGENT REPORT, AIRCRAFT HIJACKING

78
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,892
We're assessing the situation,

79
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,436
- but it's not clear yet.
- Please hold on for a moment.

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,607
- Hey! No one answer the phone!
- Don't answer the phone!

81
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,900
Hey, hang up! Hang up!

82
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,905
We lost all contact
after the captain's distress signal.

83
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,989
I see.

84
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,699
MINISTER OF TRANSPORT
MORIYAMA YOSHIRO

85
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,493
So, what do you think we should do now?

86
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,703
VICE-MINISTER OF TRANSPORT
NATSUME JUNJI

87
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,456
We should probably report this
to the Cabinet first.

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,582
Right.

89
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,169
Then let's draft a report right away.

90
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,715
<i>The Revolutionary Army boarded
the plane with loads of guns and knives</i>

91
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,467
<i>with no trouble at all.</i>

92
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,012
Before that,
how about we notify the police first, sir?

93
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,348
That's a good point too.

94
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:18,271
But I'm not sure who we should call first,
Tokyo or Fukuoka police…

95
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,441
<i>Back then, there were
no security checks before boarding.</i>

96
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>A manual for hijackings?</i>

97
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,945
Guess we'll have to check
for precedent first, huh?

98
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,322
<i>There was no such thing.</i>

99
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,950
Well,
the report should probably be addressed

100
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,702
to the Prime Minister, right?

101
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,371
That's another thing we'll need to check.

102
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,873
Good point.

103
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,375
But…

104
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,005
are we sure
there's been an actual hijacking?

105
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,090
Yes, sir. It's confirmed.

106
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,889
Keep your heads down!

107
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,141
Drop your hands, and you're done for!

108
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,809
Keep your heads down!

109
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
Turbulence.

110
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,314
We could go into a stall!

111
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,859
- Should we change course?
- What are you up to?

112
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,570
The weather's getting worse,
and the aircraft is unstable.

113
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,324
If we don't act fast, we may have
to make an emergency landing.

114
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,617
Then do something!

115
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,911
<i>A hijacking and turbulence.</i>

116
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,915
<i>In the middle of the total chaos,
the only relief was that</i>

117
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,877
<i>Captain Honda Kunihiko was a veteran pilot</i>

118
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,337
<i>with over 10,000 flight hours.</i>

119
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,214
The aircraft has stabilized.

120
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,674
This was supposed to be a domestic flight.

121
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,593
We can't make it all the way to Pyongyang.

122
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,679
Without more fuel,
we'll run out and crash halfway.

123
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,851
Yes, the captain is right.

124
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,730
For now, why don't we land
at Itazuke Airport as planned

125
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,107
and request refueling there?

126
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,946
They're heading to Itazuke?

127
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,489
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,491
I thought they were headed to North Korea.

129
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,159
Why are they flying to Itazuke?

130
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,204
Ah. Why indeed?

131
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,332
Well, we should take measures.

132
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,625
What kind of measures?

133
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
I mean…

134
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,760
<i>Just as the captain intended,</i>

135
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,805
<i>the plane landed safely at
its original destination, Itazuke Airport.</i>

136
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,265
ITAZUKE AIRPORT, FUKUOKA, JAPAN

137
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,434
<i>For a moment, it gave
the passengers some sort of hope</i>

138
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,395
<i>that this nightmare might soon be over.</i>

139
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,772
At this point,
nothing has been confirmed.

140
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:29,527
Uh, for now, our top priority is
the safety of the passengers.

141
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,071
How many hijackers are on board?

142
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,365
Have any passengers
been killed or injured?

143
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,700
When was the last communication?

144
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,034
Are the hijackers armed?

145
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,746
- Is it true they're backed by someone?
- Are all the passengers unharmed?

146
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,044
Like I said,

147
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,965
our top priority right now is
the safety of the passengers.

148
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,883
We want you

149
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,053
to fill the tanks,

150
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,724
<i>clear the runway,
and bring us the flight charts right now.</i>

151
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,810
<i>If you don't give us what we want,</i>

152
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,771
<i>we'll start killing
the passengers one by one!</i>

153
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,608
How long would it take
to fill up the tanks?

154
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,611
<i>Actually, if they're trying
to get to Pyongyang,</i>

155
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,487
<i>the fuel on board should be enough.</i>

156
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,157
What are you talking about?
That's not the point.

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,327
If we want to negotiate,
we need to buy as much time as possible.

158
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,004
Please don't shoot.

159
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,256
I brought the flight charts you asked for.

160
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,633
Here they are.

161
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,092
Move!

162
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,059
Damn it.

163
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,518
You think we're idiots?

164
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,355
No. There wasn't much time,
so we had to prepare them in a rush.

165
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,856
What about the fuel?

166
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,734
We're working on it now.
If you could give us a little more time…

167
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,370
One passenger every hour.

168
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,872
If you ignore our demands,

169
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,874
we will kill them.

170
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,376
Go on.

171
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,008
Go!

172
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,510
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,222
Hey, just drag one out first.

174
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,100
What are you doing?
Not without Mr. Yamada's orders.

175
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,268
The second-in-command gave the go-ahead.

176
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,312
We agreed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed!

177
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,649
If the passengers start panicking,
it'll be hard to control them.

178
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,317
That's the kind of thing

179
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,278
only weak, college-graduate types
like you worry about.

180
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,823
What are you standing around for?

181
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,243
Hey, you. Come here.

182
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,245
- No, wait! Please don't kill me!
- Come on!

183
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,456
Yamagata!

184
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,209
Somebody help me!

185
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,845
Shut up!

186
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,930
You want to die in his place?

187
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,142
Takashi, do it!

188
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,768
Do it!

189
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,190
Who the hell are you?

190
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,574
You need to treat the hostages carefully
until the negotiations are over.

191
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,201
Since their lives are tied to yours.

192
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,048
Who the hell are you?
What do you think you're doing?

193
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:43,053
Tell your leader I want a word with him.

194
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,325
You think you can help us?

195
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,161
How exactly?

196
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,749
First, let the women, children,
and the elderly go.

197
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,542
Why should we?

198
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,878
What you want is a revolution, isn't it?

199
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:22,384
As you know, a revolution
without public support is bound to fail.

200
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,597
But terrorists who release
women and children win favor

201
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,724
with the public and the press.

202
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,853
If you make the first move,
all the criticism falls on the government.

203
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:38,108
After that, whatever you do,
it's the government that takes the blame.

204
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,029
In the end, they'll have no choice
but to let you take off.

205
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,077
And you'll still have
over a hundred hostages.

206
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,497
Not a bad bargain, is it?

207
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,042
And then what?

208
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,837
Once you reach Pyongyang,

209
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,297
put the remaining passengers and crew
back on the plane

210
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,757
and send them home to Japan.

211
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,262
Then the press won't call you hijackers.

212
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,140
They'll paint you as heroes
who pulled off a bold operation.

213
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,852
Well, probably.

214
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,900
We can't just send the plane back.

215
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,029
We need to make
some kind of gesture to North Korea,

216
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,116
or they won't take us in.

217
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,036
I can provide that.

218
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,345
That's…

219
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,347
Mr. Yamada.

220
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,933
I told you.

221
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,352
I could help you.

222
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,774
Take a chance and trust me.

223
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:05,029
Do as I say, and you'll get what you want
without anyone getting hurt.

224
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,293
It's opening!

225
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,039
<i>In the end, they did
what I told them and let 23 passengers go.</i>

226
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>Women, children, and the elderly.</i>

227
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,463
<i>The meth in my briefcase was worth
nearly 90 million yen on the street,</i>

228
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,341
<i>and word was all over Japan
that the big shots in Pyongyang</i>

229
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,884
<i>were crazy for the stuff.</i>

230
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,722
<i>To these bastards, I was
like a jackpot that fell on their laps.</i>

231
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,641
They've released 23 passengers in total.

232
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,726
Women, children, and the elderly.

233
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,103
They really let them go?

234
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,187
Yes, sir.

235
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,522
But…

236
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,733
they're saying if we don't supply fuel
and clear the runway immediately,

237
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,902
they'll kill the rest of the passengers.

238
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,779
- What?
- Kill them?

239
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,699
- What are we going to do?
- This is a problem.

240
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,826
This is bad.

241
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,536
For now, give them what they want.

242
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,538
The passengers' safety
is our top priority.

243
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,622
What do we do?

244
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,006
They're pulling back!
The fighter jets are moving!

245
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,051
They're letting us take off.

246
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,432
We're going to Pyongyang!

247
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,067
They're fueling us up!

248
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,737
We're going to Pyongyang!

249
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,488
Let's go to North Korea!

250
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,455
Why are you helping us?

251
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,249
It's just better to handle things quietly.

252
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,045
Nothing good comes
from making a lot of noise, does it?

253
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,465
Who are you?

254
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,716
As you can see,

255
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,260
I'm just a businessman.

256
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,888
When you say a businessman…

257
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,225
you mean in this kind of business, huh?

258
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,394
It's the best money-maker there is.

259
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,229
Though it comes with its risks.

260
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,483
Are you with the yakuza?

261
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,401
No.

262
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,571
They're more like business partners.

263
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,156
Something like that.

264
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,622
Can I bum a cigarette?

265
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,508
Is that the last one?

266
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,806
We're basically in the same boat now.

267
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,058
You can spare me a cigarette, no?

268
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,611
Oh, boy. It's his last one.

269
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,419
They say once you get on meth,
you can never quit.

270
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,712
Have you tried it?

271
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,883
If you're curious, why don't you
go ahead and try it now?

272
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,972
We're ready to take off, sir.

273
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:17,906
J, A, Y, 3, 5, 1.

274
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:23,328
<i>3, 8, 1, 1, 7.</i>

275
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:40,053
KOREA GIMPO AIRPORT RAPCON,
(UNDERGROUND CONTROL TOWER)

276
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,852
RAPCON is
US Air Force, no Korea!

277
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,396
Sergeant Chae Jiseok
is going to be here soon, all right?

278
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,982
He belongs to RAPCON.
Fucking let him deal with it.

279
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,902
We're not going
to get our hands dirty here.

280
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,071
Sir.

281
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,327
You called for me, sir?

282
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,879
As of this moment,
US Forces Korea will vacate RAPCON

283
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,257
and take no part in any situation
that may arise going forward.

284
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,928
Wait, I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand.

285
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,472
Who's going to be in charge here then?

286
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,098
Hey.

287
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,434
Come here.

288
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,108
Are you the chief controller?

289
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,027
Yes.

290
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,779
Rank and name!

291
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,241
Yes, sir! Sergeant Chae Jiseok.

292
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,002
Yes, sir.

293
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,256
Yes, sir. Okay.

294
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,216
Take it.

295
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,677
Take it.

296
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,811
<i>KCIA Director here.
Are you the chief controller?</i>

297
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,895
Yes, sir!

298
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,814
<i>The KCIA.</i>

299
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,942
<i>A state intelligence agency created by
the military regime that seized power</i>

300
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,777
<i>in a coup to keep its grip on the country.</i>

301
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,114
<i>Modeled after the US CIA, it operated
under the banner of anti-communism,</i>

302
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,408
<i>handling national security,
intelligence gathering,</i>

303
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,784
<i>and covert operations abroad.</i>

304
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,036
<i>But the reality was different.</i>

305
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>Skirting the law, it terrorized the people
and wielded unchecked power.</i>

306
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,713
<i>The KCIA was nothing more
than the President's personal guard.</i>

307
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,674
<i>Listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.</i>

308
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,301
<i>These are the President's orders.</i>

309
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,845
<i>In a little while,
a plane will cross over to our side.</i>

310
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:49,057
<i>You must seize that plane
before Pyongyang does, no matter what.</i>

311
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,185
<i>Under no circumstances should you let it
reach Pyongyang first.</i>

312
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,395
<i>Understood?</i>

313
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,521
Yes, sir. Understood.

314
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,655
<i>At last,
the plane left Itazuke Airport</i>

315
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,032
<i>and headed for Pyongyang.</i>

316
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,495
<i>But it was imperative that
we never reach Pyongyang</i>

317
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,581
<i>as the Revolutionary Army wanted.</i>

318
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,128
<i>It's better to die
than to end up in Pyongyang.</i>

319
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,723
The aircraft has entered our airspace.

320
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,352
<i>Any station, any station.</i>

321
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,979
<i>This is Japan Airways 351.</i>

322
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,898

From this moment,
this is Pyongyang Airport!

Once the hijackers exit the plane,
capture them all alive.

If they resist,
you may open fire immediately.

<i>disguised as a North Korean

381
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,031
<i>They even went so far as to hang
North Korean flags on the terminal,</i>

<i>Alas, the grand operation

388
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,392
Hey!

00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,651
Here, Seoul?

391
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,320
Yes!

392
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,989
<i>…ended in failure.</i>

393
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,576
Do you want me to kill you?

394
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,786
What the hell is this?

395
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,415
Why are we in South Korea?

396
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,500
I don't know.

397
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,127
You don't know? I'm going to kill you!

398
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,005
If you kill the captain,
who's going to fly the plane?

399
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,594
What about Pyongyang?
Not going there anymore?

400
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,517
I'm going to kill you.

401
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,602
All I did was try to help you.

402
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,231
Will you make it to Pyongyang
if you kill me?

403
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,192
Don't give me that crap.
I'm going to kill you right now.

404
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,610
Calm down first.

405
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,822
There's still a way

406
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,073
Shut up!

407
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,952
I'm done falling for the words
of some <i>Zainichi.</i>

408
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,124
You think I wouldn't notice?

409
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,253
<i>Zainichi </i>like you reek, you know.

410
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,340
That same stench you get
from pigs and dogs.

411
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,466
Stop.

412
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,221
There's a way for us to get to Pyongyang?

413
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,016
You have my word.

414
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,188
I'll get you to Pyongyang safely.

415
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,233
Are you willing to bet your life on that?

416
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,528
I'll bet my life on it.

417
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,906
<i>Japan,
closely monitoring the plane's movements,</i>

418
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,491
<i>was thrown into complete chaos</i>

419
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,453
<i>and dispatched a delegation
to South Korea to assess the situation.</i>

420
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,955
I don't know how
the plane ended up landing here.

421
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,543
But now that it's in our country, there is
no way we're sending it to Pyongyang.

422
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,837
"There's no way
we're sending it to Pyongyang."

423
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,299
The mic. Mr. Jeong, the microphone switch.

424
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,800
- What about it?
- The microphone.

425
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,260
Right, sorry.

426
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,015
Who'd want to send it
to Pyongyang? None of us wants that.

427
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,975
"Who'd want to send it to Pyongyang?"

428
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,518
But listen.

429
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,896
With the passengers' lives at stake,

430
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,691
we need to leave room for negotiation.

431
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,153
So why did you let it
come here in the first place?

432
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,988
This should've been handled in Japan!

433
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,698
"It should've been handled in Japan."

434
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,993
This really puts us
in a difficult position too,

435
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,788
but the President's stance
is absolutely firm.

436
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,831
"…is absolutely firm."

437
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,211
We're well aware that public opinion

438
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,670
in South Korea isn't favorable

439
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,756
because of the recent hijacking incident.

440
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,051
But there are more than a hundred lives
on the line here.

441
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:07,388
So shouldn't we approach this
from a humanitarian perspective

442
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,932
rather than a political one?

443
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,894
Look, it's not public opinion
we're concerned about.

444
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,480
Our priority is the safety
of the South Korean aircraft

445
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,273
and citizens still held in the North.

446
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,609
We're not saying
you can't negotiate with them.

447
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,402
We're saying sending it to Pyongyang is

448
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,488
- absolutely out of the question.
- That's right…

449
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,034
- Geez, what…
- That's right.

450
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,496
After all, if we don't start
the engines from outside,

451
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,082
the plane can't even take off.

452
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,292
They're not some miracle workers,
are they?

453
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,879
In the end,
they'll have no choice but to give in.

454
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,674
<i>The South Korean government never admitted</i>

455
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,634
<i>that it had deliberately
diverted the plane.</i>

456
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,637
On that plane
are our citizens.

457
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,764
Japanese citizens.

458
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,227
They're completely innocent people,
just like you.

459
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,606
We fully understand the position
of the South Korean government.

460
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,360
But right now, please put
the passengers' lives

461
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,238
and safety above all else.

462
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,491
I sincerely urge you.

463
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,326
<i>The gap between the two sides was clear,</i>

464
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,328
<i>and there was little sign of compromise.</i>

465

<i>This is Japan Airways 351.</i>

466

<i>Unless we get air

470
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,057
<i>it will be difficult to breathe.</i>

471
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,226
<i>I repeat.</i>

472

478
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,082
Open the door.

479
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,753
Once again, open the door.

480
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,589
Like you said,

481
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,760
we pinned all the blame
on the Japanese government.

482
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,470
Good.

483
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,767
The Japanese government is
probably trying to figure out a way

484
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,020
to send you to Pyongyang
for the passengers' safety.

485
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,984
The problem is
the South Korean government.

486
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,616
They won't let you go that easily.

487
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,668
I owe you one.

488
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,094
So what's your plan?

489
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,639
You need a justification.

490
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,730
Let all the remaining passengers go.

491
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,775
You bastard. You think
we're going to fall for that again?

492
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,447
Hey.

493
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,867
Who the hell are you, really?

494
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,744
I told you.

495
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,330
I'm a businessman.

496
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,666
What are you playing at?

497
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,302
All I want is to settle this quietly.

498
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,180
Send you to Pyongyang

499
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,558
and finish my business.

500
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,519
We're not letting any more passengers go.

501
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,274
If the South Korean government
doesn't accept our demands,

502
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,443
we're killing them all!

503
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,779
And of course,
we'll cut your head off first.

504
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,656
Fine.

505
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,910
Then let's do it another way.

506
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,956
Bring me the briefcase I gave you.

507
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,500
Inside is the answer

508
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,420
to get you to Pyongyang.

509
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,990
What was that?

510
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,658
Was that a gunshot?

511
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,035
What? We've got guns?

512
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,253
Put the gun down now.

513
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,842
Otherwise,

514
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,719
we all die together.

515
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,890
Go ahead.

516
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,687
Come on, do it.

517
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,973
They heard a gunshot
from inside the plane.

518
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,892
They heard a gunshot
from inside the plane!

519
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,227
A gunshot?

520
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,354
- Good grief.
- Really?

521
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,856
As you just saw,

522
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,444
this isn't like the toys you're holding.

523
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,489
This one can actually kill.

524
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,576
So,

525
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,746
what are you going to do to us?

526
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,915
From now on,

527
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,627
you're going to quietly follow
my orders and go to Pyongyang.

528
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,421
<i>That's right.</i>

529
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,549
<i>They took the passengers
hostage to seize the plane.</i>

530
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:45,054
<i>Now, I'll take them hostage
to get out of here.</i>

531
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,808
From here on,
tell them exactly what I'm about to say.

532
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,854
We want…

533
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,401
<i>We want nothing more than that.</i>

534
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,197
"We want nothing more than that."

535
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,867
<i>If you don't meet our demands…</i>

536
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,203
"If you don't meet our demands…"

537
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,329
<i>…the second it hits noon…</i>

538
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,664
"…the second it hits noon…"

539
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,375
<i>…we'll detonate the bomb
on this plane and blow ourselves up.</i>

540
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,169
"…we'll detonate the bomb
on this plane and blow ourselves up."

541
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,588
<i>But if you do what we ask…</i>

542
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,716
"But if you do what we ask…"

543
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,468
<i>…we will safely release…</i>

544
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,970
"…we will safely release…"

545
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,054
<i>…all the passengers.</i>

546
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,222
"…all the passengers."

547
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,688
Thank goodness.

548
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,400
How can we trust them to keep their word?

549
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:45,072
To show good faith, they said
they'd release half the passengers now.

550
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,908
Fifty-eight in total.

551
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,414
They're actually releasing the passengers?

552
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,458
<i>Hostage exchange.</i>

553
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,710
<i>The condition I had Yamada deliver</i>

554
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:01,172
<i>was that a senior Japanese government
official would take the place</i>

555
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,507
<i>of the passengers
and become the hijackers' hostage.</i>

556
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,886
<i>I was a Japanese businessman
who boarded the plane with drugs.</i>

557
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,388
<i>To get out of the mess
without ending up in North Korea,</i>

558
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,474
<i>I had to find a way to settle it.</i>

559
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,395
<i>With a new hostage, the Revolutionary Army
secured their own safety,</i>

560
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,274
<i>while South Korea's justification
for grounding the plane,</i>

561
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,235
<i>citing passenger safety,
was no longer valid.</i>

562
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,906
<i>North Korea granted
the Revolutionary Army asylum,</i>

563
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,699
<i>and just as I expected,</i>

564
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,035
<i>the plane was sent back to Japan
a few days later.</i>

565
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,289
<i>They couldn't ignore the glare
of the international community.</i>

566
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,251
<i>Once repatriated, Vice-Minister Natsume
and Captain Honda were celebrated</i>

567
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:43,422
<i>as national heroes in Japan parlaying
that fame into politics and success.</i>

568
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,010
<i>But Chae Jiseok, the controller
who diverted the plane</i>

569
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,805
<i>and saved the passengers,
was never hailed as a hero.</i>

570
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,058
<i>Instead, he was pressured into silence
about what happened that day,</i>

571
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,185
<i>until he finally hung up
his uniform for good.</i>

572
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,269
<i>That's right.</i>

573
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,483
<i>That's how the President and the KCIA
keep this country running.</i>

574
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,446
- Here he comes!
- Hey, he's here!

575
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,657
GIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

576
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,992
We share the joy
of the safe rescue

577
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,620
of the abducted passengers in Seoul

578
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:18,457
with the free people of the world.

579
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,918
On this occasion,

580
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:25,881
our government and our people have
once again renewed our vigilance

581
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,509
against the atrocities
of the communist forces.

582
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,014
<i>After the incident,
Japan started airport security checks</i>

583
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,267
<i>and even enacted an anti-hijacking law</i>

584
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,230
<i>which meant the good old days
of casually boarding a plane</i>

585
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,774
<i>with a briefcase full of drugs were over.</i>

586
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:52,408
<i>Too bad about that briefcase,
but leaving it was the right call.</i>

587
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,918
It's a gift.

588
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,714
I doubt we'll ever see
each other again, but…

589
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,969
For your silence.

590
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,063
ITAZUKE AIRPORT, FUKUOKA, JAPAN

591
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,486
<i>And so,
I arrived in Fukuoka later than planned.</i>

592
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,323
<i>There'd been a bit of trouble,
but business is business.</i>

593
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,537
<i>Finally, I was about
to meet my business partner, Ikeda Yuji.</i>

594
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,623
<i>Is it a woman?</i>

595
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,416
<i>It's a woman.</i>

596
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,671
<i>I was told I had to go through her
to reach Chairman Ikeda,</i>

597
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,966
<i>and the moment I fell out of her favor,
the deal was over.</i>

598
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,275
I'm Ikeda Yuji.

599
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,569
I'm Matsuda Kenji.

600
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,448
You're very late.

601
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,326
Something came up.

602
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,788
The goods?

603
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,087
Can I borrow a light?

604
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,309
I left the goods on the plane.

605
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,230
I had to because of
the Revolutionary Army.

606
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,986
Are you talking about the plane
that went to Pyongyang?

607
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,447
That's the one. I was on it.

608
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,658
I'm sorry.

609
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,245
But I suppose
this is where our business ends.

610
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,247
Farewell.

611
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,999
It's a shame.

612
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,919
I was hoping to show Chairman Ikeda
the best there is.

613
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,762
I'll see you again.

614
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,758
Damn it.
This hill's killing me.

615
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,259
BUSAN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE, KOREA

616
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,845
It's killing me.

617
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,264
<i>After nerve-racking negotiations,</i>

618
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,017
<i>Japan's Vice-Minister of Transport,
Natsume, boarded the plane</i>

619
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,769
- <i>as a hostage himself…</i>
- Wow.

620
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,188
I thought they were
just a bunch of clueless idiots.

621
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,814
But it looks like at least one of them

622
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,275
- knew how to use his head.
- Yeah, pretty clever.

623
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,944
Back to work, people.

624
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,279
- Yes, Mr. Jang.
- Yes, sir.

625
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,447
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

626
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,120
Oh, boy.

627
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,833
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

628
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:34,004
The Manjae Gang's movements
lately. Doesn't it bother you?

629
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,547
Yeah.

630
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,343
I mean, are these punks
trying to turn themselves

631
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,804
- into export heroes by dealing meth?
- Right.

632
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,139
Why do they keep getting involved
with the yakuza?

633
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,475
- I know, right?
- Who is this?

634
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,897
Uh… We still haven't been able
to identify him, sir.

635
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,910
MEETING BETWEEN JO MANJAE
AND AN UNIDENTIFIED MALE IN A SUIT…

636
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,009
Baek!

Come here.

638
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,560
Did you enjoy your vacation?
It must've been nice.

639
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,979
You call a business trip a vacation?

640
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,109
Where are you going? The boss is in there.

641
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,954
Start talking! I said start talking! Hey!

642
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,542
Move it, asshole! Hey!

643
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,217
Talk, you bastard. Talk! I said, talk!

644
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,434
Hey, come here, you bastard!
Spit it out! Spit it out now!

645
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,313
You wanted to see me, sir?

646
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,732
Hey, you're here.

647
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,983
Good work out there.

648
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,112
Let's go talk in my office.

649
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:09,576
Hey! Start talking, you bastard!

650
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,121
Get the hell up now!

651

What've you got there?

00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,533
Uh, I got you some whiskey and cigars.

654
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,744
Come on.

655
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,872
You didn't have to.

656
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,552
Damn it. It got on me.

657
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,056
Hey, I liked it.

658
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,476
The double hijacking. Good idea.

659
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,896
Thank you, sir.

660
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:23,025
The higher-ups can't stop raving about it.
