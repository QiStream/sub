1
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:15,333
Ever since my mom passed away,
living abroad has been

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:21,083
nothing but anxiety
for someone like me with scopophobia.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,791
There were so many days
when I couldn’t even laugh.

4
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:29,791
But then,

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,708
two years, three months, and 11 days ago…

6
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:49,791
Whoa!

7
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,708
Um, who are you? Huh?

8
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:12,416
"Oh, maybe this is how I could go
to where my mom is."

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,291
The moment I thought that…

10
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,208
That's dangerous. Be careful.

11
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,291
TAKADA

12
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:25,916
Hello?

13
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:41,625
…I met the person who saved my life.

14
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,958
Thanks to him, I started kendo,

15
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:54,041
and getting active
helped lift my gloomy mood.

16
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,000
So, Darth Vader,

17
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,416
was your mother the only one
you could look in the eye while talking?

18
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,208
Yes, just my mom.

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:05,958
Wait!

20
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,333
One more person, just recently.

21
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,791
Oh, wonderful.

22
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:15,208
If there's one more person in the world,
maybe there are others too.

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,166
But I wonder why you were able
to look that person in the eye.

24
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,583
Maybe

25
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:27,041
my instincts warned me
he was a dangerous person.

26
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,833
I see.

27
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,541
But it's a shame.

28
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,125
It would've been nice
if he were your dream guy.

29
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,541
Nope. Definitely not my type.

30
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,708
For the record, she wasn't my type at all.

31
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,250
You slammed into her
hard enough to get injured,

32
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,916
but you had no symptoms?

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,041
No.

34
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,041
Nothing at all.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
That's never happened before.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,625
Hmm.

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,458
Maybe I'll call it the "Miracle Touch."

38
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,375
What?

39
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,458
I mean, it's a miracle
you were fine with that person.

40
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,208
"Miracle" is pushing it.

41
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,708
More like a coincidence.

42
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,750
It was probably just a one-time thing.

43
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,125
But what a shame.

44
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,750
It would've been nice
if she were your type.

45
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,500
"Miracle Touch," huh?

46
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,541
Excuse me, when will
Rainbow Palette be on sale again?

47
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,666
I'm terribly sorry.

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:08,375
Due to certain circumstances,
sales are suspended for the time being.

49
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,125
Why can't you bring it back?

50
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,666
I knew it.

51
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,333
Oh.

52
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,208
Is it because of the new management?

53
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,541
No, um…

54
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,458
Will it ever come back?

55
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,625
-Please tell me.
-I'm so sorry.

56
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,208
-Just tell me that.
-Excuse me.

57
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,666
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

58
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,375
-Sorry.
-We apologize.

59
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,458
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

60
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,875
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

61
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,166
-I'm so sorry.
-We're terribly sorry.

62
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,833
I'm terribly sorry.

63
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,041
It's fine, really. Don't worry about it.

64
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,416
It's not fine at all.

65
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,833
How many is that now?

66
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,375
We make these for people to eat, you know.

67
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,666
Are you listening?

68
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,708
We pour all our hearts
into making these chocolates!

69
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,583
We want lots of people to enjoy them.

70
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,166
So stop wasting them.

71
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:37,541
TRUFFLES YUZU

72
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,166
"If possible, may I continue
delivering Pure Kenji chocolate

73
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,583
without meeting in person?"

74
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:49,416
"It pains me to see
Rainbow Palette pulled from sale."

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,458
"From the Anonymous Chocolatier."

76
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,000
They won't budge, huh?

77
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,708
How will you respond?

78
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,666
"We can't sell something without knowing

79
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,083
who made it."

80
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,833
This is ridiculous!

81
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,958
Don't contact me again
until Mama comes back!

82
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,500
Sir, please calm down.

83
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,750
We just met today.
Who do you think you are?!

84
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,750
You fired her because she was a problem
for Futago Confectionery, didn't you?

85
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,541
-We just reopened.
-I'm sick of all this "we" talk!

86
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
-Just today's delivery.
-Enough!

87
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,208
I knew this would happen.

88
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,416
Losing Mama is a huge blow for us.

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,750
He's furious the floor manager quit.

90
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,083
He said he's done doing business with us.

91
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,875
Seems like he's got the wrong idea.

92
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,083
-Call him again.
-Okay.

93
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,416
Kumayuzu…

94
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,208
"A revolutionary in-house product,

95
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,250
born from the Golden Fruit
hot spring inn."

96
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,250
He's blocked our number.

97
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,416
That's something else.

98
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,458
Come in.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,166
You wanted to see me?

100
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,833
Um, about Kumayuzu…

101
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,083
They're an important supplier, right?

102
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,541
Yes.

103
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:36,125
Chef Kenji chose President Kuma's yuzu jam
from countless suppliers.

104
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,291
Its level of sweetness
pairs perfectly with our chocolate.

105
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,208
Hmm.

106
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,000
How's our stock?

107
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,208
Since we didn't receive any today,
we only have enough for a few more days.

108
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,083
Thank you.

109
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,708
Excuse me.

110
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,083
This is delicious.

111
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,458
How do you make them?

112
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,958
The secret to our Truffles Yuzu

113
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,541
is in the yuzu jam production.

114
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,250
During the jam-making process,

115
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,916
the yuzu's distinctive bitterness
is mellowed with rock salt.

116
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:32,416
That perfect balance brings out
the chocolate's sweetness.

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,333
-They're good, aren't they?
-Absolutely!

118
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,791
Enjoy.

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,291
Ms. Lee Hana.

120
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,000
When did you learn that explanation?

121
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,333
Oh.

122
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,000
It's one of my favorite chocolates.

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,916
Is that so?

124
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,416
I'll leave the rest
of today's schedule to you.

125
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,416
-Attend in my place.
-Huh?

126
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,041
Let's go to Kumayuzu together.

127
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,458
Me? But why?

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,791
-Manager.
-Yes?

129
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,500
Is it all right if she steps out?

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,208
Uh, yes. No problem at all.

131
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,958
Thank you.

132
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,916
Come on.

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,916
Get ready, quickly.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,583
Huh? Okay.

135
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,875
If someone's upset because of you,
you have to talk to them in person.

136
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,625
He's a heart-over-logic kind of guy.

137
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,916
And since his wife's Korean,

138
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,333
I figured having another Korean there
might help our chances.

139
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,625
But I can't drive, you know.

140
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,791
As you can see, neither can I.

141
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,291
Hurry!

142
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,958
Why do I have to go?

143
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,291
There you are, James Dean.

144
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,916
What? I meant you look cool.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,875
No, actually, you almost made me blush.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,583
Sorry for suddenly calling you.

147
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,500
No problem.

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,625
Oh, she's one of our staff.

149
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,916
She's Korean and works at our shop.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,250
Oh, really?

151
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,041
Hi, I'm Hiro.

152
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,250
Annyeonghaseyo?

153
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,541
Wow.

154
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,125
A-Annyeonghaseyo.

155
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,875
Oh, nice to meet you.

156
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,708
I'm Lee Hana.

157
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,750
He was my classmate in high school.
I asked him to drive us.

158
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,875
So you're friends.

159
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,708
He's smart, plays piano,
and is good at everything.

160
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,791
We were in the kendo club too.

161
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,791
Oh, so you've been doing kendo
since high school.

162
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,541
-Yeah.
-Wow!

163
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,458
Wait, why are we going to a hot spring?

164
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,541
Oh, we've got a bit of a problem
at Le Sauveur.

165
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,916
I'll explain on the way.

166
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,583
I see. Got it.

167
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,750
By the way, your Japanese is really good.

168
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,583
No, I've still got a lot to learn.

169
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,583
I've been in Japan for a while…

170
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,666
What a rude guy.

171
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,625
Okay.

172
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,666
What did you just say?

173
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,125
I said we should get going.

174
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,125
Thank you for driving.

175
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:27,041
You were just saying,
"Why do I have to go?"

176
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,333
Classic Hiro Effect.

177
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,750
Why are women always only nice to you?

178
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,291
Okay, let's go.

179
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,791
Thanks.

180
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,125
All right.

181
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,041
Excuse me.

182
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,583
Sorry to interrupt.

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,333
Oh!

184
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,416
If you'd like.

185
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,583
Thank you.

186
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,458
I bought a bunch of stuff.

187
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,875
-Hang on.
-Oh, thank you.

188
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,000
Here.

189
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,250
Th-This is fine.

190
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,708
-And this one's--
-Thank you.

191
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,875
Do you like music, Hana?

192
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,666
I do.

193
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,791
Do you have

194
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,375
a favorite genre or anything?

195
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,000
Hmm.

196
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,083
I like jazz.

197
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,125
Oh?

198
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,000
Actually, I own a jazz bar
near Le Sauveur.

199
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,291
Oh, wow! You do?

200
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,041
People from Le Sauveur
drop by all the time.

201
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,458
You should come by if you get the chance.

202
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,916
I'd love to go to Bar Brush.

203
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,708
We do live performances too.

204
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,291
Wait.

205
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,333
Did I tell you the name of the bar?

206
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,791
Let's hurry. We're short on time.

207
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,708
Oh, sorry.

208
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,125
Let's get in.

209
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,041
Right!

210
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,500
KUMAYUZU HOT SPRINGS
GOLDEN FRUIT 1.8 KM AHEAD

211
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,541
In Kumayuzu's yuzu jam,

212
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,750
the yuzu's distinctive bitterness
is mellowed with rock salt.

213
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,583
That perfect balance

214
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,000
brings out the chocolate's sweetness.

215
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,541
It's key to Le Sauveur's Truffles Yuzu.

216
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,958
-How was that?
-Yeah, I think it sounds good.

217
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,541
I'm so smart, after all.

218
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,541
So annoying.

219
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,625
What does that Korean mean?

220
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,833
Was it an insult?

221
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,208
No, not at all!

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,333
You've got sharp ears.

223
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,333
If everything goes well,
I have a favor to ask.

224
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,833
Yes?

225
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,416
Please shake hands with him for me.

226
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,416
My hand's like this, so I can't.

227
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,125
But you still have the other hand.

228
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,583
Whose fault was it that I got hurt?

229
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,500
Huh?

230
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,791
It's a bit complicated.

231
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,625
Could you help him out?

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,833
Yes.

233
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,791
Of course.

234
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,750
Seriously?

235
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,666
I'm pretty sure it's around here.

236
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:51,750
Oh?

237
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:52,833
Hmm?

238
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,541
Is it the tire?

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,666
Ugh. Damn it!

240
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,458
Yeah, it's the tire.

241
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,833
Damn!

242
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,166
Hey, do you have a spare?

243
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,791
Check the trunk.

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Do you need any help?

245
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,291
No, I've got it.

246
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,083
Ms. Lee Hana!

247
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,166
Sorry, can you give me a hand?

248
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,666
What?

249
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,125
Sorry, could you tie this for me?

250
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,125
Thanks.

251
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,041
Is it under the tools?

252
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,375
Huh? Hang on.

253
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,250
This one too, please.

254
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,416
-It won't open.
-Huh?

255
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,916
Well, if it isn't Cinderella!

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,166
I'm coming.

257
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,000
-Okay, good.
-Oh, that bear logo!

258
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,125
Let's hurry.

259
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,791
I've got this. You two go on ahead.

260
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,291
Appreciate it.

261
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,166
Ms. Lee Hana, hold out your hands.

262
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,416
My hands?

263
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,125
Grab my bag and follow me.

264
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,000
Come on, let's go!

265
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,958
Ugh, this is the worst!

266
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,458
Carry your own bag!

267
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,500
Oh, my bag!

268
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,375
Hurry!

269
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,291
Whoa!

270
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,791
That scared me!

271
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,208
H-Hey! No, no, no!

272
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,208
Sorry.

273
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,625
Hana.

274
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,208
Here.

275
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,541
No, it's no good!

276
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,500
Are you okay?

277
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,833
-Your bag.
-Oh, right.

278
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:40,916
Are you hurt?

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,041
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

280
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,166
I'm glad you're okay.

281
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,958
-How did this happen?
-Let's go!

282
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:49,875
Huh?

283
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,791
-Ms. Lee Hana!
-Y-Yes!

284
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,166
Thank you so much!

285
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,000
Take care of the car!

286
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,625
Hello.

287
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,958
I'm here to see President Kuma.

288
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,541
I'm from Le Sauveur, one of your partners.

289
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,250
Oh? Didn't you see him at the shop?

290
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,583
Well…

291
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,750
Um…

292
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,375
You're from Korea, right?

293
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,791
Oh, yes.

294
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,750
That's right.

295
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,166
Oh.

296
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,875
So, you're Korean.

297
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,708
Oh my. How nice! You speak Korean?

298
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,541
I'm Korean.

299
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,083
You are? What a pleasure to meet you.

300
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,250
What brings you here to see my husband?

301
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,166
Oh.

302
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:50,916
Our shop is in urgent need
of your yuzu jam.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,041
Could we speak with the president?

304
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,625
Oh, I see. Just a moment, please.

305
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,791
My husband's always running around,
east and west.

306
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,291
Oh, hello?

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,208
We have guests here
from one of our business partners.

308
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,958
Okay.

309
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,166
I understand. Drive safe, okay?

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,291
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,125
He might be a little late.

312
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,125
He asked if you could wait.

313
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,416
Is that all right?

314
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,916
Yes, of course.

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,083
We're happy to wait until he gets back.

316
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,916
Thank you. Please, come in.

317
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,875
-Excuse me.
-Yes, come in.

318
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,750
Hello.

319
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,791
He's with us.

320
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,041
Oh, I see. Please, come on in.

321
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,541
Right this way.

322
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,291
Thank you.

323
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,958
Please head inside.

324
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,958
-Excuse me.
-Yes, go ahead.

325
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,375
Please.

326
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,041
Please, go on in.

327
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,166
-Thank you.
-Of course.

328
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:04,333
Well then, I'll let you know
as soon as my husband returns.

329
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,416
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy your time.

330
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,958
Maybe I'll wait in the car
since I'm not really involved.

331
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,958
No, stay. It'd be awkward
if it's just the two of us.

332
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,166
Th-Then I'll go wait in the car.

333
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,958
You've got work to do.

334
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,041
Sorry, I need to go wash my hands.

335
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:37,125
I guess I'll go take a stroll then.

336
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,000
Um…

337
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,875
Oh.

338
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,458
Once,

339
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,750
when Chef Kenji was still alive,
he asked me for a favor.

340
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,041
It was

341
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,666
kind of a strange request, actually.

342
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,000
A request?

343
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:29,916
Yeah.

344
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,708
It was like a surprise gift or something.

345
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:39,833
He was trying to set me up with someone.

346
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,791
But I ended up running late,

347
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,416
so I never got to meet them.

348
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,041
No, it's not because you were late.

349
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:56,500
I don't think you need to feel bad
about something so small.

350
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,500
Chef would scold you if he heard that.

351
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,750
He was… a really kind person.

352
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,875
-Did you know Kenji personally?
-Oh!

353
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:14,208
It's just, everyone said that about him.

354
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,541
I see.

355
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,458
That's true.

356
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,041
Yes.

357
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,416
He really was kind.

358
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,833
I knew you were a good person too.

359
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,166
Hm?

360
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,125
Um.

361
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:47,625
Yes?

362
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,041
I have something to tell you.

363
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,041
Okay.

364
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,291
I…

365
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,291
Um…

366
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,208
Yes?

367
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,833
So, uh…

368
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,458
I've always liked--

369
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,458
Sorry, excuse me.

370
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,958
BETTER NOT ANSWER

371
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,375
Hello?

372
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,041
What the heck is this?!

373
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,166
It's just water!

374
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,541
-What?
-I can't drink this!

375
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,666
Sorry about that.

376
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,916
You were saying?

377
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,375
What I wanted to say was--

378
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,166
You said you liked something?

379
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,500
Rock music!

380
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:48,416
-Rock?
-I actually like rock, not jazz.

381
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,250
-It's rock.
-Oh, sorry again!

382
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,333
I got another call.

383
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,416
-Sorry.
-I-It's okay.

384
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,208
-I'm fine!
-Are you okay, ma'am?

385
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,208
Can you stand?

386
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,000
-Hello?
-Nope!

387
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,791
-Sorry.
-Hello?

388
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,000
-Are you okay?
-Let's drink, mister!

389
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,750
Hello?

390
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,875
Is this Mr. "Don't Ever Call"?

391
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,666
Uh, I'm at Bar Brush right now.

392
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,583
Your friend…

393
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,000
Wait, barkeep?

394
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:28,666
You better not tell him I said
I wanna see him, okay?!

395
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,666
She says not to tell you
she wants to see you.

396
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:33,833
Got it.

397
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,916
Okay, I'll head back now.

398
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:41,958
Yeah, okay.

399
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,666
Sorry for leaving before you guys.

400
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh no, not at all.

401
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,208
Thank you for all your help.

402
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,041
Thanks. I owe you one.

403
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,083
Okay.

404
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,666
I'll be off then.

405
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,625
See you, Hana.

406
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,208
-Take care.
-Yeah.

407
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:09,541
See you.

408
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,458
IN THAT CASE, I'M AFRAID TO INFORM YOU

409
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:35,583
WE CANNOT CONTINUE THIS CONTRACT WITH YOU

410
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,208
Oh, um…

411
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,416
Darn bug…

412
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,958
He's taking a while.

413
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,125
Welcome back!

414
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,166
Sorry to keep you waiting.
My husband's back!

415
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,500
Okay.

416
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,458
Are you the new president of Le Sauveur?

417
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,875
From Futago Confectionery?

418
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:21,083
That's you, isn't it?

419
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,125
Yes.

420
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,958
Um…

421
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,041
You waited all this time
without even eating?

422
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:31,916
Come, this way.

423
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:37,083
Come, please. Right this way.

424
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,333
In Kumayuzu's yuzu jam,

425
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,458
the yuzu's natural bitterness is, uh…

426
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,958
Rock salt. Mellowed with rock salt.

427
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,291
Right! With rock salt--

428
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:17,541
I'm so sorry! Forgive me!

429
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,333
I made you come all this way!

430
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,125
I rushed over to Mama's place,

431
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:27,458
and she yelled at me
for not delivering the yuzu jam.

432
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,833
She's scary when she gets mad, huh?

433
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:33,791
The truth is,

434
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,750
when I heard Mama had quit,

435
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:40,083
I figured that an arrogant
and entitled new president

436
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:45,500
from Futago Confectionery
had forced her to leave.

437
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,916
I couldn't forgive that.

438
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,708
But I was wrong.

439
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,958
She told me herself.

440
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,333
It's her eyes, right?

441
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,083
Diabetic retinopathy.

442
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,500
It's developed, hasn't it?

443
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:09,625
She said she's going back to her hometown
in Nagano to focus on her treatment.

444
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,500
You paid her retirement
and medical expenses.

445
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:17,250
And even introduced her
to a top university hospital doctor.

446
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:23,708
You really went above and beyond for her.

447
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:28,125
I'm so grateful,
from the bottom of my heart!

448
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,625
No, uh…

449
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:32,791
I didn't do anything special.

450
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,458
We did what any company would--

451
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,541
No!

452
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,083
Most people wouldn't go that far.

453
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,375
Oh, no.

454
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,583
Huh? What?

455
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,250
Hmm?

456
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:19,708
Yes?

457
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,083
The shirt in your bag?

458
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,000
Huh?

459
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,583
Excuse me for a moment.

460
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,208
Huh?

461
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,375
What's going on?

462
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:40,875
I brought the shirt you asked for.

463
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,125
Whoa!

464
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,166
Why are you half-naked?

465
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,208
This isn't it.

466
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,125
You said you wanted a clean shirt.

467
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,541
This isn't clean.

468
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,833
They all looked the same!

469
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,541
That's why I told you
to bring the whole bag.

470
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,333
Hurry and go get it!

471
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,916
What a creep.

472
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,708
What do I do?

473
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,208
Oh!

474
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,791
There's no time. Just wear this!

475
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,708
I can't wear this!

476
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:25,291
Why do you have to change
now of all times?

477
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,416
Because…

478
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,583
I told you it's complicated.

479
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,041
I don't even know why it's complicated.

480
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,958
What do you expect me to do?

481
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,833
I don't need to share my secret.

482
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,541
I don't wanna hear it anyway.

483
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,541
That's enough!

484
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,125
I'm done.

485
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:45,208
I can't wear this.

486
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,708
No manners at all!

487
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,666
He'll be back soon,
so please wait a bit longer.

488
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,958
Oh, okay.

489
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,666
What's the matter?

490
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,375
My apologies, Mr. Kuma.

491
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,583
Not at all.

492
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,000
My shirt got a little dirty.

493
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,625
Oh, is that all?

494
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:27,666
I was so worried
I'd done something to upset you.

495
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh no, of course not.

496
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,166
We just refreshed the hot spring water.

497
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,791
Why not take a soak
and relax after dinner?

498
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,041
Are you sure?

499
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:41,208
Yes.

500
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,333
I want to tell you how I feel

501
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,541
But when you're near

502
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,333
I can't say a word

503
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:59,208
I really hate that about myself

504
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,916
I need to be brave

505
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,375
So I won't have regrets

506
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:13,958
Little by little, I'll get closer to you

507
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,791
-And I'll--
-Ms. Lee Hana?

508
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,125
What song is that?

509
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,291
Is it a Korean song?

510
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,500
It's a good song.

511
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,625
What's it called?

512
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,375
It's a secret.

513
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,333
Sorry for interrupting.

514
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,541
Please, go on.

515
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,208
How could I?

516
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,750
Why…

517
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,250
didn't you tell me?

518
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:00,958
Huh?

519
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,666
Tell you what?

520
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:07,958
The reason Mama quit.

521
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:16,416
There were all sorts
of rumors going around.

522
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,833
That's because…

523
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,875
I don't want anyone to worry.

524
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,666
Can you…

525
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:32,833
keep it between us?

526
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:34,916
Please, sir.

527
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,583
Okay.

528
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,000
RESIGNATION LETTER

529
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:45,708
She said she didn't want
anyone to know the real reason.

530
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,875
Is it really that important?

531
00:35:54,625 --> 00:36:01,208
But in the end,
you kept her secret, didn't you?

532
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,958
I'm sure she appreciates that.

533
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,416
You think so?

534
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,833
I'm the same.

535
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:17,500
We all have secrets.

536
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,541
Things we'd rather hide,

537
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,541
or if possible…

538
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:30,291
things we never want anyone
to find out about.

539
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,458
Do you have a secret like that?

540
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:41,208
Oh, never mind.

541
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,958
You don't have to answer.

542
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,750
If it were easy to say,
then it wouldn't be a secret.

543
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:48,916
Yeah.

544
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,291
Dear Anonymous Chocolatier,

545
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,125
I've had a change of heart.

546
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,583
I'd like to keep things as they are.

547
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:38,833
Please keep delivering
the chocolates as usual.

548
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:45,458
I understand you may have
reasons you cannot share.

549
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,375
I was being inconsiderate.

550
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,250
I'd like to bring back Rainbow Palette.

551
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,750
Therefore,

552
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,750
please resume deliveries
starting tomorrow morning.

553
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,083
Huh?

554
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,666
Tomorrow?!

555
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:09,666
What's wrong?

556
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,375
Are you okay?

557
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,041
No, not at all!

558
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:18,666
Ugh!

559
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,125
Once again…

560
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,333
Thank you so much!

561
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,958
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

562
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:35,875
Well then.

563
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,666
We'll be going now.

564
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,333
-Take care.
-Safe travels.

565
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,083
Take care.

566
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,250
Thank you.

567
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,416
Please come again.

568
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,625
I will.

569
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,875
C-Can I sit in the front?

570
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes, go ahead.

571
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,083
Wait.

572
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,916
Could you wrap this around your shoes?

573
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,833
Excuse me?

574
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:02,541
I don't want you getting in
with those shoes.

575
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,500
Please.

576
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:06,416
Okay.

577
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,833
What a jerk.

578
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,833
Of course.

579
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:29,291
What urgent business
do you have at this hour?

580
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,416
It's your fault, you bastard.

581
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,666
Another insult? Please stop that.

582
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,958
No, no. You've got it wrong.

583
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,625
Oh, by the way,

584
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,166
I emailed
the Anonymous Chocolatier earlier.

585
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,041
Oh?

586
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:53,166
Since Rainbow Palette goes back
on sale tomorrow, and it's the weekend,

587
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,791
many customers must be
looking forward to it, right?

588
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,916
So I doubled the order.

589
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,791
Isn't that a good idea?

590
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:05,125
Yes.

591
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,791
Honestly, what should I do
with this ssagaji?

592
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,041
I told you, stop insulting me.

593
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:13,958
No, no.

594
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:17,916
I said you're amazing,
and an absolute genius.

595
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,166
-Yup.
-Liar. You definitely didn't say that.

596
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,250
-What was that? Ssagaji?
-Huh?

597
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,583
-Ssagaji?
-What?

598
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,416
No, I didn't say that.

599
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,541
Huh?

600
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,666
I said you're a genius.

601
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,125
Can I ask you something?

602
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,125
Why do you avoid
making eye contact with people?

603
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,916
That's…

604
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,083
my secret.

605
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:58,625
I see.

606
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,750
Then

607
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:04,666
why is it you can look me in the eye?

608
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,125
Like this.

609
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,666
Don't go.

610
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,333
Stay with me.

611
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:11,041
Like you did back then.

612
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,291
Oh, I'll get off here.

613
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,416
Huh? Aren't you in a hurry?
I can drive you home.

614
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,791
It's fine.

615
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:40,875
All right.

616
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:56,541
Wait.

617
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,250
Um.

618
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:10,875
Could I…

619
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,458
shake your hand?

620
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:17,916
Hm?

621
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,958
Oh, uh,

622
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:23,416
just to say thank you
for everything today.

623
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,791
Sure. I don't mind.

624
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:39,291
Thank you…

625
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,125
so much

626
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,833
for everything today.

627
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:50,750
Huh?

628
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,083
Wait. Are you crying?

629
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,916
What? No! Why would I cry?

630
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,583
You were squeezing my hand too hard.

631
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,750
How strong are you?

632
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,125
I thought you were going
to hurt my hand again.

633
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,458
Wow.

634
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,500
I didn't know

635
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:18,666
tears could well up like that,
all at once.

636
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:22,500
I've never seen that before.

637
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,375
Come on.

638
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:30,500
You're the one tearing up now.

639
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:33,708
Oh.

640
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,416
That's because

641
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,333
you looked sad first.

642
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:40,583
You don't need to be sad with me.

643
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,916
This is all new for me too--

644
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,875
Anyway…

645
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,375
I'm heading home.

646
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:09,333
Maybe he's not such a bad guy?

647
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,500
So warm.

648
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,875
