1
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,961
NO TAIL TO TELL

2
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,089
Sis, I found a way!

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,132
It's going to take some time,

4
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,052
but I found a way for you to turn back

5
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,804
into a nine-tailed fox.

6
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,765
Okay, let's talk about it later.

7
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:01,186
That means he can
go back to his life too, right?

8
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,356
Wait a second.

9
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,402
What are you guys talking about?

10
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,991
Woo-seok, the thing is--

11
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,076
Turning back into a nine-tailed fox?

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,496
Then that means…

13
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:29,381
You weren't actually doing this for me.
You just couldn't go back?

14
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,924
Well…

15
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,927
- Let me explain--
- That's right.

16
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,513
It's exactly as you heard.

17
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,390
So what? What's it to you?

18
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,934
- Hey!
- Nothing's going to change anyway.

19
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,894
Me, Si-yeol, and you.

20
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,522
We're all going back
to the way things were.

21
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,608
It'll just take a little more time.

22
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,819
Really?

23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,365
How much longer?

24
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,666
So you're saying you're human now,
just like the rest of us?

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,711
And you're looking for a way back, right?

26
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,217
So you found a way? How?

27
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,055
Now that useless human's involved,
this all just got a lot more complicated.

28
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,893
So there's a chance we can't switch back
if that method doesn't work?

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,104
Well, that is a possibility.

30
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,898
Why the hell do you care?

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,650
This matters to me as well.

32
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,362
Why?
Are you afraid I might get in the way?

33
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,239
You tell me.

34
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,325
I think you're fully capable of that.

35
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,787
So tell me.
Are you going to get in the way?

36
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,668
Stop it, both of you.

37
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,919
Why are you acting like this?

38
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,547
You heard what he said, didn't you?

39
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:56,718
Don't tell me you're still clinging
to the idea of human friendships.

40
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,971
- You're just being too harsh.
- Si-yeol.

41
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,933
I need to know what's going on.
Otherwise I can't relax.

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,936
And there might be something
I can do to help.

43
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,730
You shouldn't just hide everything
from me like this.

44
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,649
I understand what you're saying.

45
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,151
Still, it would be best
if you left for now.

46
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,654
- Later, if I need--
- Erase it.

47
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,948
Pardon?

48
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,449
Erase that human's memory.

49
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,577
But my spiritual power isn't that strong--

50
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,706
I know. Just do it.

51
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,790
Okay.

52
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,167
No, wait--

53
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,974
What the…

54
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,977
I was just waiting for Si-yeol.

55
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,146
Why am I here?

56
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,068
DAD

57
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,320
Hi, Dad.

58
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,489
Why are you just picking up now?

59
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,867
I can't really remember right now--

60
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,411
Have you been drinking
at a time like this?

61
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,579
No, it's not that--

62
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,206
Do you know what kind of mess you caused?

63
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,292
You went to Korea
without the club's permission.

64
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,043
Are you out of your mind?

65
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,131
It's the preseason right now.

66
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,258
I've got the international call-up
next week anyway.

67
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,051
I just came to Korea a few days early.

68
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,678
What's the big deal?

69
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,931
You've still got training,
even in preseason!

70
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,433
You just transferred,

71
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,519
and you've already upset the coach
and the club owner.

72
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,730
You're being unprofessional!

73
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,482
Do you think I'm doing this for myself?

74
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,941
What?

75
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,194
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

76
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,947
Let's keep it like this…

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,450
for now.

78
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,827
Thank you, Si-yeol.

79
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,040
Wait, what was that memory just now?

80
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,419
Did I actually meet Si-yeol?

81
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,213
By the way,

82
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,173
where is the house?

83
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,884
It's right here.

84
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,679
Isn't this a public restroom?

85
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,932
There are lots of these in the mountains.

86
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,438
This isn't a restroom.
It's what we call a rooftop apartment.

87
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:19,528
It might not look like it,
but people actually live here.

88
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,071
It's a home.

89
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,491
Was it really necessary to go that far?

90
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,117
What?

91
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,247
I don't think we had to go so far
as to erase Woo-seok's memory.

92
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,458
We could've just explained it
and sent him on his way.

93
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,253
You still don't seem
to grasp the situation.

94
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,630
If you'd talked to him nicely
and sent him on his way,

95
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,049
do you think
you'd ever sleep soundly again?

96
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,551
What do you mean?

97
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,928
Well, let me give you an example.

98
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,307
If you just dropped dead tonight,

99
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,101
who do you think would benefit?

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,185
What?

101
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,437
No more worrying about
when he'd have to switch back

102
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,941
or about ending up back
in this shabby rooftop place.

103
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,152
Everything he has now
would be his forever.

104
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,031
How long do you think
it'll take him to realize that?

105
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,658
A day or two?

106
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,745
Jeez, why is your example so morbid?

107
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,040
What, are you saying Woo-seok
will try to kill me or something?

108
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,251
Come on, that's nonsense.

109
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,419
Don't you remember?

110
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,796
What did your friend do
when I gave him the chance

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,631
to switch your lives back?

112
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,383
I mean, that was then.

113
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,094
This is a different situation.

114
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,722
Besides, Woo-seok's not that kind of guy.

115
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,849
Get real. Humans are all the same.

116
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,560
You think there's
a special "kind" that's any different?

117
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,230
Anyway, erasing his memory
is just a temporary fix.

118
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,984
An eight-tailed fox doesn't have the power
to fully wipe a human's memory.

119
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,821
Whether it takes a few days
or a few months,

120
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,991
your friend's memory will eventually
come back, bit by bit.

121
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,160
Oh, really?

122
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,954
So we need to get back to how things were

123
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,707
before your friend remembers
and gets any funny ideas.

124
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,586
Now that the nuisance is taken care of,

125
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,213
why don't you finish what you were saying?

126
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,506
You found a way?

127
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,592
Right, yes.

128
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,718
All we need is

129
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,513
for you and me to switch fates.

130
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,682
Like you did with him.

131
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,400
What?

132
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,917
What's with her?

133
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,136
EPISODE 6
THE FALSE KINDNESS

134
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,151
Come in.

135
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,116
PERSONAL PROFILE
KANG SI-YEOL

136
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,784
So who is this guy?

137
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,910
Nobody special.

138
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,247
He went through rehab for about a year
after the accident,

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,582
and his soccer career
went downhill after that.

140
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,961
He was recently cut
from a fourth division team too.

141
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,421
So what does he do now?

142
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,048
He doesn't seem to have a job.

143
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,176
So, does he come from a rich family?

144
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,636
Not at all.

145
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,849
He has no parents
and no inheritance either.

146
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,060
That can't be right.

147
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,648
He's a client of that money-grubbing fox,
and you're telling me he's broke?

148
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,776
That makes no sense.

149
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,653
Anything else peculiar?

150
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,907
There's something I found out
during the investigation.

151
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,577
You know the boy
who was a witness to that incident?

152
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,829
Apparently, he's Hyeon Woo-seok.

153
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,748
Hyeon Woo-seok?

154
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,041
While you were away,

155
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,418
this athlete named Hyeon Woo-seok
became a huge star--

156
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,087
I watched the World Cup in prison too.

157
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,130
I know who he is.

158
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,882
Oh, okay.

159
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,344
Hyeon Woo-seok.

160
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,517
Kang Si-yeol is completely broke,

161
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,062
but Hyeon Woo-seok is his friend?

162
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,945
I think I should meet this Hyeon Woo-seok.

163
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,879
I feel a bit better now.

164
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,423
Usually, I last half a day in human form,

165
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,259
but erasing his memory
must have drained me.

166
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,179
If you've got your strength back,

167
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,223
could you finish
what you were saying earlier?

168
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,225
Earlier? I meant exactly what I said.

169
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,896
I mean, is switching fates
actually possible for you?

170
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,649
You tried switching Woo-seok
and me back last night,

171
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,025
but it didn't work.

172
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,822
That's because I lack power right now,
but what if I become a nine-tailed fox?

173
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,575
What?

174
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,328
Then I'll have powers too,

175
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,247
so we can just switch our fates.

176
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,791
You can become
a nine-tailed fox instead of me,

177
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,793
and I can become human faster.

178
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,002
It's good for both of us.

179
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,797
Then what about me?

180
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,049
I don't think
there's anything I can do about that.

181
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,969
But she can probably help you later.

182
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,470
Wait, why?

183
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,431
You could just switch me back first
after you become a nine-tailed fox.

184
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,724
It's urgent for me too.

185
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,268
It doesn't work that way

186
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,353
because I'm the one who cast that spell.

187
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,897
- But--
- I'm younger than her,

188
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,483
and my spiritual power is much weaker.

189
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,529
So even if I become a nine-tailed fox,
it'd be hard for me to undo her spell.

190
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,116
Well, okay then.

191
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,953
It doesn't matter how we get there
as long as I get my life back.

192
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,997
Well, the logic holds up.

193
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,207
So problem solved, right?

194
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,504
Nothing's solved.

195
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,258
I was wondering
what you were talking about.

196
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,220
That doesn't sound like your idea, though.

197
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,098
Who told you that crap?

198
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,184
Pardon?

199
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,103
Well…

200
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,398
I was told not to say anything
because it's a secret.

201
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,817
You don't have to say it. It's obvious.

202
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,944
What's obvious?

203
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,155
Just go. Quit talking nonsense.

204
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,532
- But sis--
- I said, go.

205
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,451
You're talking nonsense.

206
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,038
Why are you chasing her off?

207
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,916
- Should I really go?
- No.

208
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,209
Listen to me.

209
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,837
I'm telling you this
for your own good, so pay attention.

210
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,050
You are being scammed.

211
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,094
What?

212
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,263
Why do you want to become human?

213
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,681
What do you know about them?

214
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,101
Do you honestly think
that was your own idea and decision?

215
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,978
Well…

216
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,439
Isn't that just the way it works?

217
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,150
It's what all the other foxes did.

218
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,402
And the ones above said
it's the right path.

219
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,197
Works for me.
If I trick a clueless kid like you,

220
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,407
I can become a nine-tailed fox again.

221
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,408
But what about you?

222
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,953
You turn human, totally unprepared.

223
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,204
Then what?

224
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,456
When you regret it later,

225
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,126
you think the ones above
are going to help you?

226
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,262
What's so bad about living as a human?

227
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,514
I like it. I'm satisfied.

228
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,724
You're satisfied? Right now?

229
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,102
Hey, that's different.

230
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,646
I'm only in this mess because of you.

231
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,606
I was perfectly happy with my old life.

232
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,108
It's all the same.

233
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,443
You could've fallen apart
at any time, with or without me.

234
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,861
Isn't that what human life is?

235
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,698
You never know
how your life will turn out either.

236
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,491
Your old age might be miserable.

237
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,575
What?

238
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,244
Did you seriously just say that to me?

239
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,830
Anyway, I'll figure out
how to change back on my own.

240
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,791
So go live your own life
and mind your own business.

241
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,543
But…

242
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,254
No, no. You don't get to
decide that for her.

243
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,090
She just wants to become human
as soon as possible.

244
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,133
Unlike you.

245
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,052
She didn't make that decision
knowing all the facts.

246
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,848
You'll be glad you stayed
a nine-tailed fox in the end.

247
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,892
But like I said, that's not your call.

248
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,645
How is what you're doing any different
from the ones above?

249
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,480
What?

250
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,608
You chose your own way of life, right?

251
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,153
Well, she's got her own path too.

252
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,195
Right?

253
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,823
I mean, I guess.

254
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,867
What do you mean by that?

255
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,828
So you're dead set on becoming human?

256
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,497
Well…

257
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,126
The decision's up to you.
Don't worry about anyone else.

258
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,962
You want to become human, don't you?

259
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,298
That's right!
You decide since it's your life.

260
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,601
Now that you're both pressuring me,
I'm not so sure.

261
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,940
Talking to you is pointless.

262
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,737
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 2

263
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,115
Let go of me! I'm the victim here!

264
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,117
You're going to pay for this!

265
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,119
Get your hands off me!

266
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,668
I'm scared, sis.

267
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,921
Don't look away. Watch.

268
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,881
If you become human,

269
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,217
you'll have to live among trash like them.

270
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,718
What?

271
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,261
I have to live around them?

272
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,971
With people like that?

273
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,767
She won't run
into people like them very often.

274
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,060
Yes, she will.

275
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,232
These people can spot
clueless kids like you

276
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,692
a mile away, you know?

277
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,194
Just look at her face.

278
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,029
Doesn't it just scream "easy target"?

279
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,832
Hey, what are you in for?

280
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,377
- Mugging.
- You?

281
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,587
- Online scam.
- You?

282
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,256
- Assault.
- You?

283
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
Illegal filming on the subway.

284
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,469
Wow, you must be so proud of yourselves!

285
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,762
Excuse me.

286
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,515
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

287
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,725
Make sure you investigate them thoroughly.

288
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,395
See that?

289
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,189
The human world will rob you blind
right under your nose.

290
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,608
Do you really think

291
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,404
you can survive
dropping into this den of evil?

292
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,489
Well…

293
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,907
Hey, hold on.

294
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,286
You shouldn't pressure her
for an answer in a place like this.

295
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,792
The human world has its good side too.

296
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,753
This time, I'll take you somewhere nice.

297
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,055
Feel free to eat whatever you want here
without worrying about what others think.

298
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,016
Really?

299
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,643
In all my 500 years,
I've never seen so much food.

300
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,315
Wait, hold on.

301
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,901
Like this.

302
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,169
Slow down.
No one's going to take it from you.

303
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,217
This is the best food
I've had in half a century.

304
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,302
That's because you were stuck
in the mountains,

305
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,472
eating nothing but greens.

306
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,308
This is nothing, really.

307
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
Back when I was a nine-tailed fox,

308
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,732
I ate way better stuff than this.

309
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,486
There are so many delicious things
in the human world.

310
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,781
If you become human,
you can eat like this every day.

311
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,498
You really think so?

312
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,295
You can't just go in there.

313
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,592
How much do you think
that meal you ate cost?

314
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,054
I don't know.

315
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,597
The human world has classes.

316
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,057
Here…

317
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,477
Right.

318
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,479
That one over there is at the very bottom.

319
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,316
No matter how many dishes she washes,

320
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,652
she'll never be able
to afford a meal like you just ate.

321
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,405
Why? Because the pay is garbage.

322
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,116
Who starts out as a chef from day one?

323
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,742
Everyone works their way up.

324
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,580
You think hard work is
all it takes to get to the top?

325
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:05,585
There are tons of humans who end up
washing dishes their whole lives.

326
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,552
You have to leave!

327
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,512
Just get out, please.

328
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,097
Unbelievable.

329
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,432
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,643
You got us kicked out
before we could really eat.

331
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,646
- Did I say anything wrong?
- Wrong or not, that's not the point.

332
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,607
Why on earth are you taking it this far?

333
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,029
Do you actually have another way
to get back to how it was?

334
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,031
Well…

335
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,326
Not right now, but--

336
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,912
See? You don't have one.
This is the only way.

337
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,498
So why are you being so difficult?

338
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm not.

339
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:52,048
But you're saying I should just stand by
and watch when I know how this turns out?

340
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,259
It's obvious what'll happen
if that idiot suddenly becomes human.

341
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,970
Since when did you care so much
about other people?

342
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,472
What?

343
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,517
Excuse me.

344
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,813
We went to the police station
because you wanted to,

345
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:11,275
and we came to this restaurant
because Si-yeol wanted to.

346
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,820
So?

347
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,950
So, isn't it my turn to go where I want?

348
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:24,080
There's somewhere I've always
wanted to go in the human world.

349
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,964
Sis!

350
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,550
She doesn't know the first thing
about the world,

351
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,719
so where did she even hear
about a place like this?

352
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,556
She said the stranded kid she saved
kept bragging about it.

353
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,850
Just play along.

354
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,856
What's so fun about that anyway?

355
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,193
Si-yeol, how long do we have to do this?

356
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,412
Now, that's better.

357
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,173
- Did you have fun?
- Yes!

358
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,345
But the kids in front of me and behind me

359
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,347
were all riding with their mom or dad.

360
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,515
So?

361
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,268
You want me to act like your mom now?

362
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,312
No, it's just that I keep riding alone.

363
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,524
You should be grateful
we even came here with you.

364
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,942
No!

365
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,957
Tell them to stop this thing!

366
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,643
That was so much fun, sis!

367
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,103
Let's ride it again!

368
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,521
I can't ride it again.

369
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,648
Why not?

370
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,695
This is a really popular ride,
so the line takes forever.

371
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,239
Is that why?

372
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,202
What's going on?

373
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,329
This fixes everything, right?
We don't have to wait.

374
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,789
No, don't!

375
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,248
Don't do it!

376
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,543
What the…

377
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,297
I'm going to kill that idiot fox!

378
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,358
Hey, are you okay?

379
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,237
I'm dizzy, and I feel sick.

380
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,364
I feel like I'm dying.

381
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,325
This damn human body.

382
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,829
I'm so sorry, sis.

383
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,456
I thought you'd like it too.

384
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,416
Hey.

385
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,169
Look at me right now.
Doesn't it make you feel anything?

386
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,546
Do you still want to be--

387
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,423
Sis, let's go on that one next!

388
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,221
Is a tail really
the only thing she's missing?

389
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,472
If you ask me,

390
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,183
I think she's got you
wrapped around her finger.

391
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,227
What?

392
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,481
Just accept it. It's easier that way.

393
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,359
We're coming.

394
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,193
That hurts.

395
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,362
It really hurts!

396
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,157
You of all people
shouldn't be scared of that!

397
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,163
I wasn't scared. I was just startled.

398
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,333
Those fake ghosts aren't even scary.

399
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,503
Unbelievable.

400
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:06,654
The Divine Spirit told me
that an ominous guest would arrive today.

401
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,451
That must be you.

402
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:18,040
They say you're
the best shaman in Sancheong.

403
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,212
You've invited quite the ghost in.

404
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:32,638
The sorrow of losing one's family
is a pain anyone can sympathize with.

405
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,685
But you dare defy the will of Heaven
and devour every divine spirit?

406
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,812
Save your breath.

407
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:44,358
I have my reasons,
so hand over that ghost behind you.

408
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:53,450
I was trying to catch a fox,
but it was just too vicious.

409
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,411
I'm running low on spiritual energy.

410
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,956
The karma you carry
is already as deep as the ocean.

411
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,083
How will you handle all that sin?

412
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,921
What's a little rain to the ocean?

413
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,215
So,

414
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,802
let's not be too difficult about this.

415
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,356
I never thought I'd say this,

416
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,068
but even after things go back to normal,

417
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,404
I'll probably still think about today
from time to time.

418
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,201
I mean,

419
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,995
it's my first time at a place like this.

420
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,458
You've never been to an amusement park?

421
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,045
Don't humans go to these places
all the time as kids?

422
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,547
My grandmother was out working,

423
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,008
so I never got to visit places
like this as a kid.

424
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,929
And being on the sports team,
I hardly ever got to go on field trips.

425
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,934
You haven't really done much, have you?

426
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,227
I've been everywhere.

427
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,771
Jayeon Nongwon, Bugok Hawaii, you name it.

428
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,148
You have?

429
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,067
You were just puking your guts out.

430
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,945
That's because of this damn human body.

431
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,740
You get sick from just a few rides

432
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,867
and have to wait an hour
for a one-minute ride.

433
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,870
How is this supposed to be fun?

434
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,330
You know,

435
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,959
you look like
you're having the most fun here.

436
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,840
I only did this

437
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,635
because you guys made me.

438
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,312
What's wrong?

439
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,107
- What?
- Let me see.

440
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,445
Your heel is all scraped up.

441
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,031
Why didn't you tell me
before it got this bad?

442
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,827
I thought this was normal
when you walk a lot.

443
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,329
That's ridiculous.

444
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,374
Jeez, you're bleeding.

445
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,792
That must've really hurt.

446
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:55,924
Wait.

447
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,179
Are you worried about me right now?

448
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,264
Why?

449
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,933
Am I not allowed to worry about you?

450
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,856
I mean,

451
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,151
it's just unexpected, that's all.

452
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,155
Technically, what you're suffering through

453
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:23,994
is also kind of my fault, in a way.

454
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,621
So…

455
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,373
So, is it your fault or not?

456
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,710
I don't know. Think whatever you want.

457
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,671
It just so happens that right now,

458
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,883
you're the only person
in the world on my side.

459
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,803
I don't have any friends or family
I can rely on.

460
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,057
You're all I have.

461
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,352
So you should worry about me too.

462
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,145
I'll be worrying about you.

463
00:28:55,901 --> 00:29:00,322
And if anything were to happen to you,
I'd never be able to go back to my life.

464
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,241
So how can I not worry?

465
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,953
Especially with all the enemies
you've made with your misdeeds.

466
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,289
What?

467
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,042
Now that sounds more like you.

468
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,710
Anyway, just wait here.

469
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,337
I'll go grab a bandage.

470
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,806
Sis!

471
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,276
So, what's your wish?

472
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,944
What?

473
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,614
We made a bet
about a hundred years ago, remember?

474
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,367
We said that whoever becomes human first
gets their wish granted.

475
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,743
Don't tell me you forgot.

476
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,162
Oh, that?

477
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,500
Do you want me to dig up
that wild ginseng I hid?

478
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,253
I hear it sells for a fortune
in the human world.

479
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,922
Or maybe I should visit
the king in his dreams

480
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,968
to tell him to promote that scholar
you've got a crush on.

481
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,971
The mountain god
will scold you for that.

482
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,348
Only if I get caught.

483
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,059
You think I'm like you?

484
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,853
I know how to get around the rules.

485
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,148
I don't want to wish for things like that.
My wish is…

486
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,824
for you to do good deeds
and focus on your cultivation.

487
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,703
What? I do that every single day.

488
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,082
Not things like that--

489
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,627
So that you become human quickly.

490
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,672
We could live in the same village,

491
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:45,719
make mugwort rice cakes in the spring,
and make kimchi in the winter.

492
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,223
Wouldn't it be nice
to grow old together like that?

493
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,647
But Geum-ho…

494
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,316
Yes?

495
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,278
What if it takes me a long time?

496
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,785
What if I finally become human,
and you're already a hunchbacked granny?

497
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,578
Hey, don't say that.

498
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:16,541
Grandma! Let's go pick mugwort!

499
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,709
Grandma!

500
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,754
- Let go of me!
- No!

501
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,047
Let go!

502
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,924
Never!

503
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,219
Sis!

504
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,264
Why are you standing here alone?

505
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,684
Tell me.

506
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,646
Do you still want to become
human that badly?

507
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,148
What?

508
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,235
I used to know someone a long time ago.

509
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,488
She was a fox, just like us.

510
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:51,201
She cultivated herself for a long time
and finally became human.

511
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,538
What happened to her?

512
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,249
She died

513
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:01,461
after dragging herself through a long,
cruel, miserable life.

514
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,508
That's what human life is to me.

515
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,803
It's fleeting, weak, and fragile.

516
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:15,058
And you still want to be one of them?

517
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,442
You know,

518
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,361
today was really special for me.

519
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,488
How about for you?

520
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,450
What?

521
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,453
All this time, I wasn't exactly happy,

522
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,913
but I wasn't exactly unhappy either.

523
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,708
I just haven't had any days
that were memorable.

524
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,085
That's because you've been holed up
in the mountains--

525
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,879
Then what about you?

526
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,840
You've lived in the human world
this whole time.

527
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,134
Have you had a lot of happy days?

528
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,762
Or even terribly unhappy ones?

529
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,143
I want to become human.

530
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,353
Maybe I'll be unhappy.

531
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,190
Maybe there will be moments
I can barely stand.

532
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,483
But still,

533
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,985
I want to live a life that's memorable.

534
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,447
Even if it's short,
I want it to be intense.

535
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,700
I want to be swept away.

536
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:19,873
Not a life where I can predict
and control everything.

537
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,959
I want to be tossed about, swept along,

538
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,629
crying one minute, laughing the next.

539
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,672
I want to live a real life.

540
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,220
Some days,
I want to be torn apart by regret.

541
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,472
I want to feel hollow.

542
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,559
But when I laugh,
I want to laugh out loud.

543
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,271
Sis.

544
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:48,360
Even if I'm unhappy, sad,

545
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,946
and eventually die,

546
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,156
I still want to become human.

547
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,119
I will never become human.

548
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,082
I won't love a human as you did.

549
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,168
I won't live in misery,
and I won't die in despair.

550
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,337
I'll never

551
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,507
live like you.

552
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,679
Eun-ho.

553
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,017
Geum-ho?

554
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,270
Are you with me?

555
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,606
Do you recognize me?

556
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,234
I've…

557
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,571
lived my own life

558
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,031
with no regrets.

559
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,160
You need to live yours.

560
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,915
Whatever that may be.

561
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,558
Yeon-su?

562
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,686
Isn't that Yeon-su over there?

563
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,355
No way.

564
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,317
She's single. How could she have two kids?

565
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,864
Goodness, these kids.

566
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,408
They've made a mess here too.

567
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,840
Mom, hurry up!

568
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,634
Yeah, I'm coming!

569
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,728
Why are you being so moody?

570
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,522
Hold this.

571
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,528
You are so stubborn.

572
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,032
You're not a nine-tailed fox
who can use earth-folding anymore.

573
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,708
Where did the other one go, anyway?

574
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,502
She left.

575
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,129
What? Where to?

576
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,297
Where do you think?

577
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,508
She's from the mountains,
so she went back.

578
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,343
- Let's go.
- Wait, hold on.

579
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,553
Wait for me.

580
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:21,721
Hey!

581
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,057
What's going on?

582
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,518
Did you guys fight while I was gone?

583
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,687
If that's not it--

584
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,647
You got exactly what you wanted.

585
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,482
- What?
- We didn't fight.

586
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,651
We decided to switch our fates.

587
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,194
- Really?
- Yes.

588
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,570
Wait, hold on.

589
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,197
For real?

590
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,033
So it's all sorted?
Do I get my life back now?

591
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,162
Get a grip, Si-yeol.

592
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,207
You can't just
go back to normal overnight.

593
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,043
Why not?

594
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,671
Did you already forget the condition?

595
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,717
That half-wit eight-tailed fox
has to become a nine-tailed fox

596
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,760
before we can change our fates.

597
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,554
Right.

598
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,141
But how long will that take?

599
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,642
Will it be quick?

600
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,894
Usually, it takes about 100 years.

601
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,064
What? A hundred years?

602
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,567
Did you think
growing an additional tail was easy?

603
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,361
How can you be so calm about this?

604
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,613
You think you'll still be alive by then?

605
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,492
Oh, come on! What's the point
if I die of old age first?

606
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,745
I said, usually.

607
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,291
So there's another way?

608
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,211
It takes 100 years for total rookies.

609
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,088
But I'm a pro.

610
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,008
I've got some tricks up my sleeve.

611
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,766
Is that…

612
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,643
Brace yourself.

613
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,772
Just so you know, this won't be easy.

614
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,192
We'll be slammed starting tomorrow.

615
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,088
What?

616
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,549
I was too distracted to notice before,

617
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,552
but this place is a total dump.

618
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,430
What?

619
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,100
You call this a home?

620
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,770
You can be broke and still have taste.

621
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,730
A roof and walls don't make a home.

622
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,357
Are you kidding me?

623
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,734
This isn't even really my place.

624
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,947
I changed your fate,
not your sense of style.

625
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,282
You just don't remember it,

626
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:49,452
but you're the one
who decorated this place.

627
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,913
And I saw your original place too.

628
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,249
It was completely empty.

629
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,709
Just some weird machine
you get into naked.

630
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,923
That's just a crash pad
for when I'm in Korea.

631
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:07,637
My actual house in the UK
has a pool and a private theater.

632
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,473
The closet is huge, and the decor is--

633
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,268
This is so depressing.

634
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:18,106
I need to change back as soon as possible.
I can't live like this.

635
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,484
Yeah, I'm rooting for you.

636
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,904
Where are you going?

637
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:25,905
What?

638
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,199
Why? You need something?

639
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,577
I'm tired. I'm going to go rest.

640
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,122
I get that you're tired,
but why are you going in there?

641
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,916
There's only one bedroom,
so obviously it's mine.

642
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,545
This is my home.
And I slept in there last night, didn't I?

643
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,423
That's because I slept
with the eight-tailed fox.

644
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,884
Starting today, I get the bed.

645
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,886
I'm the oldest here.

646
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,098
Sure, whatever you say.

647
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,768
You're older than the Republic of Korea.
How can I beat that?

648
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,562
I'll just have to serve you.

649
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,068
Then I'm going to go wash up.

650
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,946
Hold it.

651
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,948
I get to shower first too.

652
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,783
Elders first.

653
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,154
Si-yeol.

654
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,616
Si-yeol.

655
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,993
Wake up.

656
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,663
Hello?

657
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,084
My gosh!

658
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,586
What do you want now?

659
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,797
I'm hungry.

660
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,799
What? At this hour?

661
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,426
Come on.

662
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,553
You said you were stuffed
from the lunch buffet.

663
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,888
So you refused to eat dinner.

664
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,848
I was full then.

665
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,810
Now I'm hungry, so I can't sleep.

666
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,396
This damn human body.

667
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,107
Just try to go back to sleep.

668
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,401
You'll get fat if you eat this late.

669
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,072
It's fine. Once I turn back,
I won't gain weight anyway.

670
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:36,077
Any more of that stuff
she was eating yesterday?

671
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,414
What? Ramyeon?

672
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,352
Dig in.

673
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,363
So good.

674
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,823
Is it that good?

675
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,283
Yeah.

676
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,411
Why did you only make one, though?

677
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,537
Aren't you eating?

678
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,165
No, I don't eat at this hour.

679
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,958
Especially not stuff like this.

680
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:31,090
I think the last time I had ramyeon
was 12 or 13 years ago.

681
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,844
Come on, just have one bite.

682
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,137
It's really good.

683
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,016
No, I'm good.

684
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,561
We both reset when we go back anyway.

685
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,271
Just eat it while you can.

686
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,402
I guess that's true.

687
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,783
Then just one bite.

688
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,349
Come on, surely you want more than that?

689
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,600
What?

690
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,976
Right.

691
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,354
Right?

692
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,398
I'll just have one more bite.

693
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,161
What the heck?

694
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:48,960
Hey!

695
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,295
You can't just eat it all.

696
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,089
There's nothing left for me!

697
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,259
Should we make another?

698
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,929
Make it two.

699
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,101
Tastes better with three eggs.

700
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,936
- Mix in some rice?
- Yeah.

701
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,150
What is this?

702
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,818
What is it?

703
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,778
What's wrong?

704
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,574
Oh no… my face.

705
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,162
You're all puffy.

706
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,540
I told you not to eat that late.

707
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,667
You think your face looks any better?

708
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,752
You're all puffy too.

709
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,753
Me too?

710
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,966
What the heck?

711
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,470
I think the swelling's going down a bit.

712
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,764
We should've just gone for a run.

713
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,517
I told you we'd be busy starting today.

714
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,811
We can't waste energy on useless stuff.

715
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,398
What an excuse.

716
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,401
Whatever. Just go change the spoons.

717
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,736
Get the cold ones.

718
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,407
- Nice!
- Nice!

719
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,825
That's it!

720
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:06,370
Move it up! There we go!
Seo Beom, shoot! Shoot it!

721
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,875
- Nice!
- He skied it, damn it.

722
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,502
This is so frustrating.

723
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,880
Coach, would you like some water?

724
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,340
Forget it. Put that away.

725
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,258
- Cross it in!
- Okay!

726
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,429
Come on, block him!

727
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,350
- Block him!
- Block!

728
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,729
Nice!

729
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,025
You've got to move up as a group, okay?

730
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,443
Hey, Bae Jeong-bae!

731
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:41,405
All you do is send crosses all day.

732
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,366
Try cutting inside sometimes.

733
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,368
And dribble
the ball up the field like this

734
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,203
so that they get confused!

735
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,829
Yes, sir.

736
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,707
How does the water taste,
Seo Beom, you punk?

737
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,459
You call that a shot?

738
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,919
You skied it way up there.

739
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,796
I thought you'd hit a damn airplane.

740
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,005
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,382
Damn it.

742
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,970
Are you guys just gonna play defense
the whole time and go home?

743
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,681
You have to score goals to win!

744
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,932
But why?

745
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,893
Why isn't anyone making a proper attack?

746
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,312
But, Coach.

747
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,815
Who are we supposed to cut back to?

748
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,899
What?

749
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,652
Well, even if we cut back,
there's nobody there to take it.

750
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,778
Hey, why isn't there?

751
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,155
Kang Si-yeol would be right…

752
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,162
Just pass it to the forward striker.

753
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,581
Who's the forward striker?

754
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,542
- What?
- If we're being realistic,

755
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,670
we don't have a proper striker
on our team right now.

756
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:48,514
Don't you guys know modern soccer?

757
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,808
Total soccer.

758
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,060
Everyone attacks, everyone defends--

759
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,437
Excuse me, Coach.

760
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,480
- Instead, can't we just--
- No!

761
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,776
You're trying to bring up

762
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,612
Kang Si-yeol again, right?

763
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,449
You listen to me carefully.

764
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,868
Over…

765
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,288
my dead body.

766
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,665
That punk Kang Si-yeol is out!

767
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,002
Out for good!

768
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,888
Didn't you say we'd be super busy?

769
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,556
But we're not exactly fishing here.

770
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,933
What are we doing?

771
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,021
Fishing?

772
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,731
We're doing something similar.

773
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,858
Except we're fishing for people, not fish.

774
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,527
What? Fishing for people?

775
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,279
Yes.

776
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,199
Because from now on,
we're on a "Good Deeds Project."

777
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:51,994
Fine.

778
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,164
No matter what I say,
I get that you want to become human.

779
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,624
But before that,

780
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,253
becoming a nine-tailed fox
is no easy task to begin with.

781
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,630
Are you ready for that?

782
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,841
Can you follow my lead without complaint,
no matter what I ask?

783
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,927
Follow what exactly?

784
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:10,930
What?

785
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,183
From here on out, you're on your own.

786
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,185
I'm not the one in a rush.

787
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,145
Wait.

788
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,231
Well…

789
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,777
I mean, I'm still going to help you.

790
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:29,031
But you need to do good deeds
to build spiritual power so your tails--

791
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,200
Then I'll just give you my fox bead.

792
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,786
I'll use a spell to connect us

793
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,164
so you can do the good deeds
and build the spiritual power for me.

794
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,797
My transformation is about to wear off,
so I have to run.

795
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,508
What do you say?

796
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,927
I think you were right.

797
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,057
I swear, she's got me
wrapped around her finger.

798
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,562
So what you're saying is,
when you do good deeds,

799
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,190
she gains the spiritual power instead?

800
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,526
But you can't actually use
her fox bead's power yourself.

801
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,861
That's right.

802
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,947
That's why from now on,
we have to do good deeds.

803
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,284
Aggressively and in massive amounts
in a short amount of time.

804
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:19,540
But what does that
have to do with fishing?

805
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,041
Seriously?

806
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,919
Do I have to spell out
every single thing for you?

807
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,337
Who do you think is the reason

808
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,798
I'm stuck as a human
and suffering like this?

809
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,596
It's because I saved your life!

810
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,225
Okay, fine. So what?

811
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,228
One human embodies an entire world,

812
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:46,734
so saving a person's life
is basically saving an entire world.

813
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,153
In other words,

814
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,948
the ultimate good deed,
the highest virtue of all,

815
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,033
is saving a life.

816
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,711
Wait, don't tell me.

817
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,422
That's not what you're doing, right?

818
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,217
You're waiting for someone to jump
so you can save them?

819
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,178
Why? Is there a problem?

820
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,137
Hey!

821
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,764
Forget the problem!
How's that a good deed?

822
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,432
The karma will get you, you know?

823
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,436
Why would karma get me
when I'm saving a life?

824
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,606
Unbelievable.

825
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,691
Okay, fine.

826
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,945
I don't expect much
from your moral compass anymore,

827
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,490
but putting that aside,
it's just inefficient.

828
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,742
Do you honestly think this makes sense?

829
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,287
- It doesn't?
- No!

830
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,874
It's like lying under a tree
waiting for fruit to fall!

831
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,543
How long do you plan on waiting?

832
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,627
You think so?

833
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,506
I guess you're right.

834
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,968
You do have a point.

835
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,682
Given the urgency,
this does feel too passive.

836
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:00,766
Exactly.

837
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,102
Even if the good deeds are forced,

838
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,480
we should try to do them the normal way--

839
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,856
Fine.

840
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,442
I'll just have to find another way.

841
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,492
SHAMAN'S SHRINE
ADULT STORE

842
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,120
GAME LAND
IMAGE SHOP

843
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,251
Here, Si-yeol.

844
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,295
Take this and burn that place down.

845
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,255
What?

846
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,965
Are you out of your mind?

847
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,216
Don't worry about it.

848
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,761
I know the guys inside. I met them
back in my nine-tailed fox days.

849
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,724
Loan sharks, illegal gambling,
organ trafficking, you name it.

850
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:46,395
This place is crawling with wicked
and evil people doing that kind of stuff.

851
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,772
Trust me, they deserve to die.

852
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,441
Hey.

853
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,152
Didn't you just say
that "one human is a whole world"?

854
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,446
And now you want me
to burn people to death?

855
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,655
What are you talking about?

856
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,407
I'm a very cultivated beast, you know.

857
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,992
Then what's this for?

858
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,287
You start the fire,
then I'll swoop in and put it out in time.

859
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,748
Or we can just call the fire department.
That'd mean I saved

860
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,959
a bunch of lives
in that building all at once.

861
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,546
First the river, now fire?

862
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,382
You really will stop at nothing.

863
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,302
I can't do this. I won't.

864
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,638
Do you honestly think this makes sense?

865
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,015
What's wrong now? Why not?

866
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,185
Jeez, you never just agree to anything.

867
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:30,689
So you're talking about
a false kindness, aren't you?

868
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,441
The important part is the kindness.

869
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,525
Hey!

870
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:36,028
You want us to be the bad guys,
not the good guys!

871
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,114
Either way, we're still saving them.
That's all that matters, isn't it?

872
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,367
Don't you know
what happens to the bad guys?

873
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,911
They always end up ruined
and in the gutter.

874
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,245
Enough!

875
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,748
I'm older than any bad guy out there.

876
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,375
So just do as I say.

877
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,461
If you want to start a fire,
do it yourself.

878
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,921
I can't do it.

879
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,508
I would've done it already if I could.

880
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,844
I need to do good deeds,
so I can't do bad things.

881
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,222
Oh, so you know it's bad?

882
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,348
Fire!

883
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,517
Fire!

884
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,103
Did you…

885
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:10,896
It wasn't me.

886
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,315
It really wasn't. I'm right here.

887
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,320
But where is the fire?

888
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,085
HOPE ORPHANAGE

889
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,090
- Did you call 911?
- Yes.

890
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,884
But the children are still inside!

891
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,594
There are children inside?

892
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,971
Yes.

893
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,891
Here, hold this.

894
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,729
Si-yeol, what are you doing?

895
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,272
You wait here. It's too dangerous.

896
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,481
What?

897
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,360
Si-yeol!

898
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,047
Si-yeol, I can't see a thing.

899
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,508
I told you not to come! It's dangerous!

900
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,218
Come to think of it,

901
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,680
if anyone saves the kids,
it has to be me, not you.

902
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,183
What? Are you crazy?

903
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,101
Cover your face with this.

904
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:35,314
I think the fire started in the basement.

905
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,691
Let's get the kids out
before it spreads up here.

906
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,533
- Hey, kids.
- Teacher!

907
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,496
Are you all right?

908
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,372
Okay, let's go.

909
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,044
Take the kids and get out first.

910
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,171
I'll check over there,
then follow you out.

911
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,506
I'm scared!

912
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,382
Let's go.

913
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,190
Is that everyone?

914
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,110
I can't find So-jeong!

915
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,057
They're out!

916
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,853
Oh, So-jeong!

917
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,658
Where's the woman I was with?

918
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,369
She went back inside just now.

919
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,121
What?

920
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,584
Why won't this open?

921
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,211
Damn it, open up!

922
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,199
Don't be ridiculous.

923
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,744
You think I'm going to die like this?

924
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,257
Eun-ho!

925
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,800
Eun-ho!

926
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:09,843
Si-yeol.

927
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:13,889
Seriously, what are you doing?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

928
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,854
Eun-ho, are you okay?

929
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,775
Si-yeol!

930
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,926
Oh, you're awake.

931
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,846
What?

932
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,183
Wait, what happened?

933
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,731
Si-yeol. Where is he?

934
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:06,400
Excuse me?

935
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,361
Wait, ma'am!

936
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,863
- Where are you going?
- Si-yeol!

937
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:17,703
Si-yeol!

938
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,917
Where is Si-yeol?

939
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,505
You looking for me?

940
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,343
People will think I'm actually dead.

941
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,304
Why are you calling out for me like that?
I'm right here.

942
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,724
I seriously thought you were dead.

943
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,934
Were you scared?

944
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,729
It just so happens that right now,

945
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,065
you're the only person
in the world on my side.

946
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,819
I don't have any friends or family
I can rely on.

947
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,072
You're all I have.

948
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,284
So you should worry about me too.

949
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,244
I'll be worrying about you.

950
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:03,749
Eun-ho.

951
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,376
You told me to worry.

952
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,463
You said I should worry about you!

953
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,883
I'm really okay, I swear.

954
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,470
Since when do you actually
listen to what I say?

955
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,614
If you had died,
I would've killed you myself!

956
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,199
NO TAIL TO TELL

957
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,784
Are you sure you're doing this right?

958
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,953
We haven't gained
one bit of spiritual power.

959
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,621
Why isn't the power building up?

960
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:28,041
How about we try
doing good deeds by the book?

961
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,711
What if I stay human
and just die of old age?

962
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:35,257
Was there really nothing good
about becoming human?

963
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,801
Last name Lee, first name Yoon.

964
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,177
You bastard!

965
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,262
Kang Si-yeol.

966
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:43,014
- He must be a very close friend of yours.
- This memory…

967
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,183
It is you.

968
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:48,353
I know this is all your fault!

969
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,567
