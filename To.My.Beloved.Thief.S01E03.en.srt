1
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,468
There you are.

2
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,303
Lady Flower.

3
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,556
He's not here for Gil-dong.

4
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,768
But how?

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,771
The notice board.

6
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:10,153
Should you be this man, or know of him,
please come forward to Physician Hong.

7
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,533
How he came here doesn't matter now.

8
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,577
Let's stay composed.

9
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,913
That man is an aide.

10
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,581
I'm only making myself look suspicious.

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,792
You look quite embarrassed from the back.

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,210
Or am I just imagining it?

13
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,132
Oh, dear!

14
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,510
It is you!

15
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,554
That's why your voice sounded familiar.

16
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,097
For someone who didn't recognize me,

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,350
you turned around pretty fast.

18
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,726
What?

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,769
No way.

20
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,146
I wouldn't have recognized you
and then pretended not to.

21
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,732
It's quite dark tonight, so…

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,692
It's bright.

23
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,027
The moon is shining brightly.

24
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,532
Exactly.

25
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,951
A strange man barged in
under the bright moonlight,

26
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,161
so I naturally took a step back.

27
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,082
This is a time when a man and a woman
should keep their distance.

28
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,291
I see.

29
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,919
So now you want to keep your distance.

30
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,297
What about the other night?

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,390
About the other night…

32
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,937
-Well--
-Say little.

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,564
Yet convince me.

34
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,859
Unexpected feelings?

35
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,153
I'm fine with that too.

36
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,620
As you can see,

37
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,123
I lied about my class,

38
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,709
and there's no excuse.

39
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,961
So I have

40
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,339
no explanation that could convince you

41
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,509
to excuse my rudeness toward a nobleman.

42
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,139
But most of all,

43
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,182
about leading you on--

44
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,475
Lead me on?

45
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,103
I know that

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,231
just an apology

47
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,275
cannot excuse that behavior.

48
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,070
A mistress and a slave, my foot.

49
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,741
Does this mean you ran away that night
because you knew my class?

50
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,200
Not at all.

51
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,871
I was wearing silk clothes too
when we first met at the market.

52
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,331
-Why?
-What?

53
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,791
Why? What are you getting at?

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,629
Well…

55
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,094
It's like a complicated

56
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,638
and somewhat impulsive--

57
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,805
Mistake?

58
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,934
Yes, that's the right word.

59
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,645
Don't you think that's exactly
what it shouldn't have been?

60
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,898
I apologize.

61
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,193
Whatever the punishment may be,

62
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,819
I will accept it without complaint.

63
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,238
Too bad.

64
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,658
Punishment was never my concern.

65
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,913
So you want me to take the initiative
and go to the constabulary.

66
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,122
Yes. Are you still here?

67
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,375
I'm on my way.

68
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,754
Though it was a misunderstanding,

69
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,257
you saved the life
of the dullard slave boy.

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,217
Let this repay what you did that day.

71
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,097
To be fair, that was my carelessness too.

72
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,309
What happened to your arm?
Did you get hurt?

73
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,644
It's not a big deal.

74
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,937
Let me take a look.

75
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,565
You said you would only look.

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,152
Just looking won't do.

77
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,582
Stopping the bleeding is enough.

78
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,459
That's what I came here for after all.

79
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,424
Isn't it because you saw the notice?

80
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,633
What notice?

81
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,676
Nothing.

82
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,265
Does that mean

83
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,350
this is a coincidence too?

84
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
Well,

85
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,229
a coincidence means
an unexpected encounter,

86
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,690
but I had too many expectations.

87
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,860
And my plea was heard.

88
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,129
What do you mean?

89
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,841
If you were in my place,

90
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,218
wouldn't you have been desperate
to catch you too,

91
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,720
after you ran away like that?

92
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,263
I see.

93
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,020
It's a stab wound. How did you get it?

94
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,938
I was grazed by an arrow.

95
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,819
An arrow, at this late hour?
What happened?

96
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,156
I was helping someone escape.

97
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,910
Helping someone escape?

98
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,038
Things went awry,
and I ended up putting someone on the run.

99
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,625
In any case,
it is still quiet out tonight.

100
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,502
It probably means
that person escaped safely.

101
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,671
Just stay within

102
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,881
what I can handle.

103
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,717
Was I mistaken?

104
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,843
Stop!

105
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,180
Could he have said that
to the officers, not Gil-dong?

106
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,350
If that's the case, he got this wound

107
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,936
because of me.

108
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,230
What's the matter?

109
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,148
What? What do you mean?

110
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,817
You keep staring at it.

111
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,986
Because I couldn't see the wound well.

112
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,238
Please move this way.

113
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,535
In any case,

114
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't know the whole story,

115
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,747
but the person you helped

116
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,916
must surely be grateful.

117
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
I don't think so.

118
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,964
He must be feeling bitter, thinking,
"This wretch fooled me."

119
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,592
I'm sure it wouldn't last long.

120
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,677
No.

121
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,804
I can hear him faintly,

122
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,473
cursing at me.

123
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,725
No way! I would never…

124
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,602
think he would do that.

125
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,023
I mean, I wouldn't if I were him.

126
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,735
There's no need to comfort me.

127
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,363
He was hit by an arrow?

128
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,364
Did you see it?

129
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,659
No, one of the soldiers slipped
and loosed his bow.

130
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,035
This is a grave matter.

131
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,371
-Find the Grand Prince at once!
-Yes, sir!

132
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,544
The wound isn't that deep,
but it might leave a scar.

133
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,755
When it becomes light,
make sure to go to a private physician.

134
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,092
Here, at the Hyeminseo,
we don't have enough herbs

135
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,428
to dress the wound properly.

136
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,222
How much are you lacking?

137
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,517
We never have enough herbs

138
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,145
for the flood of patients we see each day.

139
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,773
Is that so?

140
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,367
You look like you're treating
a gravely ill patient.

141
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,080
Treating your wound with care
is the least I can do.

142
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,624
Well,

143
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,585
I'm taking it just as seriously.

144
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,504
It may be best that you do not.

145
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,590
For a second,
I wished my injury was worse.

146
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,136
Worse?

147
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,680
You cannot make that kind of joke
in the Hyeminseo.

148
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,642
I mean it. I always have.

149
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,810
Even that night,

150
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,355
when I was waiting for someone.
It was not like me.

151
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,694
You seemed confused.

152
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,575
And it intrigued me.

153
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,826
I thought

154
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,204
I could share in that confusion too.

155
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,420
All that, not knowing
it was a mere mistake.

156
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,140
About what happened that night,

157
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,225
let me apologize again--

158
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,268
Don't bother.

159
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,644
You must be upset--

160
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,937
I'm not upset.

161
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,647
But you look really upset.

162
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,815
I'm really not…

163
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,989
Your apology is what upsets me.

164
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,034
No need to come outside.

165
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,829
It seems like our coincidence ends today.

166
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,547
He looks upset even from the back.

167
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,634
Was there something wrong with my apology?

168
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,763
Where could she possibly be?

169
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,517
Your Highness.

170
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,811
I still haven't found this woman.

171
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,021
I apologize.

172
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,649
What do you mean by that?

173
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,402
I'm offering my apologies.
I'll find her tomorrow at all costs.

174
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,570
Exactly.

175
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,239
You made a mistake,
so you had to apologize twice.

176
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,867
Would you like me
to apologize three times?

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,369
No. And no more apologies from now on.

178
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,289
You are here, Your Highness!

179
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,583
How is your injury?

180
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,084
It's all right, as you can see.

181
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,419
Have you injured yourself?

182
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,630
-Who did this?
-Put it back.

183
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,381
What happened to Gil-dong?

184
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,467
He ran away without even looking back.

185
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,469
How cold of him.

186
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,058
I can't believe we met again.

187
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,393
I may actually grow fond of him.

188
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,104
Eun-jo!

189
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,105
Come quickly.

190
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,068
What are you doing here?
It's cold outside.

191
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,027
Earlier today,

192
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,363
I was questioned at the constabulary
about Gil-dong.

193
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,031
What? Let me see. Are you all right?

194
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,324
I'm all right.

195
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,909
That's not the problem.

196
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,536
Come with me.

197
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,957
Are you saying

198
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,419
the aide at the constabulary
sent all these?

199
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,587
Yes.

200
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,091
What did the aide look like?

201
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,886
He has a face as fair as the first snow,

202
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,014
his eyes as clear as crystal.

203
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,683
Truly a man of remarkable beauty.

204
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,104
I see.

205
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,023
Are we really talking
about the same person?

206
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,858
What did you say?

207
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,819
Nothing.

208
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,154
He sounds like a nice person,

209
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,906
showing you such kindness.

210
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,451
Oh, dear.

211
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,249
I'm glad

212
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,252
that it was a misunderstanding.

213
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,466
What?

214
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,344
This is what His Majesty said.

215
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,473
"The censors' remonstrances are becoming
more and more flattering."

216
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,976
"They're all lies."

217
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,561
Are you saying

218
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,271
our remonstrances to His Majesty

219
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,190
must first be approved by you
because of that?

220
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,819
That is utter madness!

221
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,991
Flattery too

222
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,452
requires wit.

223
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,707
Here. Have a look.

224
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,835
Look at your greed.

225
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,552
The tributes you extorted from the people.

226
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,804
Please give us more time!

227
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,223
The land you seized from the people.

228
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,728
The slaves you beat to death.

229
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,063
Every one of them

230
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,608
represents your greed.

231
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,776
I did hear

232
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,945
of your vile habit

233
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,823
of gathering ammunition
against the officials.

234
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,284
So this confirms it.

235
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:10,080
Last time, I had no chance to show you
this because of Grand Prince Dowol.

236
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,499
Are you blackmailing me?

237
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,756
Let us call it camaraderie.

238
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,426
Because I want you
to remain in that position

239
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,221
more than anyone else.

240
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,891
What?

241
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,226
Did you really take

242
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,020
all the wedding gifts
back to Chief Secretary Im's house?

243
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,313
With this back carrier?

244
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,484
Why did you do that?
That's what they paid for Eun-jo!

245
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,653
Have you no shame?

246
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,154
Think of Eun-jo.

247
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,991
She set out again at dawn today
to tend to ailing women.

248
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,993
My lord, please stop.

249
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,328
I wish

250
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,914
Eun-jo had been born
the eldest son of this household.

251
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,375
A fool like me
should have been born a slave!

252
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,377
Please stop, Young Master.

253
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,296
The exam results were announced today.

254
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,756
And I failed, of course.

255
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,134
I know shame,
so I will not ask for comfort.

256
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,441
Did you get the red pass?

257
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,778
Please, no congratulations.

258
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,450
First place?

259
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,288
You sly one.

260
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,582
So you weren't just idling all this time.

261
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,672
What's that?

262
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,800
Lord Hong Min-jik
sent back the wedding gifts.

263
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,430
That old geezer Hong
just can't let go of his pride.

264
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,765
What?

265
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,685
You were abroad studying before,

266
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,270
so you must not know Lord Hong.

267
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,231
He acts all righteous,
as if he's better than everyone else.

268
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,775
Father looks out for him
because they're friends,

269
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,152
but that man disgusts me.

270
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,529
I will make his daughter's life miserable

271
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,574
the moment she sets foot in this house.

272
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,619
You don't need to be so harsh
with your concubine.

273
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,997
As if.

274
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,459
She's being sold
as our grandfather's concubine, not mine.

275
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,085
She will be a caretaker.

276
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,463
What?

277
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:27,259
Apparently, that girl begged
to keep this information from Lord Hong.

278
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,477
You stood in a nobleman's way.

279
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,062
Forgive me, my lord!

280
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,356
Please forgive me, my lord!

281
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,608
Please forgive me!

282
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,362
Please forgive me, my lord!

283
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,051
All of you, show your respects.

284
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,359
What's all this?

285
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,445
The royal court has sent us
medicinal herbs.

286
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,656
Who in the royal court sent them?

287
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,783
Grand Prince Dowol.

288
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,078
That should cover a year's worth
of the Hyeminseo's herb supply.

289
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,622
How generous.

290
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,544
The physician of the royal court said
His Highness is exceptionally handsome.

291
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,965
It must be nice to work in the court.
You can see His Highness there.

292
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,511
This is all great,

293
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,139
but isn't this a bit random?

294
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,648
Her Majesty does not wish
to receive visitors.

295
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,155
Please tell Her Majesty
I'll return tomorrow.

296
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,080
To continue where we left off,

297
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,125
all the medicinal herbs you sent
to the Hyeminseo were for their patients?

298
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,543
Yes.

299
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,964
She said they never have enough herbs
for all the patients.

300
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,424
So I had to do it.

301
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,676
-This is great.
-What do you mean?

302
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,346
The physician who treated you
must be in shock by now.

303
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,806
-Why?
-"Oh!"

304
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,851
"The man I treated a few days ago
was the Grand Prince!"

305
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,186
Like this.

306
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,897
I told you to donate anonymously.

307
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,648
Were they bestowed under my name?

308
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,401
Yes. There are unsavory rumors
about Your Highness.

309
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,944
This should be made known.

310
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:51,904
They're my rumors.

311
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,365
Now that they know, why not visit
and encourage them in person?

312
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,495
There's no need.

313
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,207
It may help soothe
the Queen Dowager's anger.

314
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,918
I like that pretext.

315
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,047
Now, bring me the finest-looking horse
from the Royal Stables.

316
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,964
Now?

317
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,299
And on your way back,

318
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,551
stop by the Office of Royal Attire
and pick up the vest

319
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,011
made with silk from the Ming.

320
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,137
Is that necessary?

321
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,181
You keep answering with questions.

322
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,641
I apologize…

323
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,105
Right. I'm not allowed to apologize.

324
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,607
That was just me talking to myself.

325
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,070
Move!

326
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,832
You're going to be married soon.
You don't need ribbons.

327
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,376
You should be looking at hairpins.

328
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,130
You need one to pin up your hair
the morning after the wedding night.

329
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,382
Are you making fun of me?

330
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,967
What's wrong?

331
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,845
You even read the erotic book to study.

332
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,182
I was merely trying to understand.

333
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,018
I wanted to understand it,
so I could hate it less.

334
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,814
It's the lord.

335
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,357
What? Where?

336
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,484
Once he finds out
we came out without permission,

337
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,694
we'll be in serious trouble.

338
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,196
Get on your knees.
We must confess our wrongdoing and--

339
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,239
Run!

340
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,949
Run? Run where?

341
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,326
Where to?

342
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,675
Halt.

343
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,512
-Let's take another route.
-Yes, my lord.

344
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,236
Did I get caught?

345
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,405
I'm so in trouble.

346
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,244
Wait, he's from…

347
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,835
Excuse me.

348
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,717
Please help me.

349
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,525
I don't know whose daughter she is,
she must be the bane of the family.

350
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,413
I believe you're out of mortal danger now.

351
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,047
I'm alive.

352
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,385
Is he the Grim Reaper or something?

353
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,096
He's my brother.

354
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,015
He believes it is dangerous
for women to go outside.

355
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,685
I appreciate your help today.

356
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,899
Take care.

357
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,567
Dae-chu.

358
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,247
My lady.

359
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,292
Kkot-sim,

360
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,377
am I the invisible type?

361
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,629
Pardon?

362
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,842
If he doesn't remember me,

363
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,761
I must not have made

364
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,805
much of an impression, right?

365
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,983
Hello? Anybody in there?

366
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,072
So, I must wait in that line
to be treated?

367
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,241
That will not be necessary,

368
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,577
if you say you're the Grand Prince.

369
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,870
Be quiet.

370
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,497
Are you not here for an inspection?

371
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,958
There will be no inspection.
It'll only cause disruption.

372
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,669
Look! Are you okay?

373
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,382
Look here! Wake up!

374
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,219
Sir.

375
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,304
Eun-jo.

376
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,639
Let's carry her.

377
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,266
No, we must calm her down first.

378
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,226
If we move her now,
it will worsen her seizure.

379
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,312
-Please bring a physician.
-I will.

380
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,772
Ma'am.

381
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,900
Can you hear me?

382
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,779
Don't try to fight back, relax.

383
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,656
Relax your body and just lean on me…

384
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,000
We just need to stay with her
until a physician comes?

385
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,172
Ma'am.

386
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,800
Breath with me. Follow me.

387
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,802
One.

388
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,054
One.

389
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,473
You're doing great.

390
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,558
Again. One.

391
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,562
One.

392
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,941
One.

393
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,529
-One.
-What happened?

394
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,241
She had a seizure. It has just subsided.

395
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,076
-Move her inside.
-Yes, sir.

396
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,083
Let's go.

397
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,189
Did he leave?

398
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,325
Are you looking for me?

399
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,079
Thanks for helping me with the patient.

400
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,668
I brushed off the dirt and dust.

401
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,962
But the fine fabric has been ruined.

402
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,131
If you need compensation…

403
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,591
I need no compensation.

404
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,343
But this is troubling me again.

405
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,722
I know.

406
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,558
Your hands are not
for tying knots on your robe.

407
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,454
What are you doing? I just tied it.

408
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,585
Leave it.

409
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,048
My hands can bind up a wound though.

410
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,591
Later.

411
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,384
I'll do it later.

412
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,098
You treated my wound the other day
so now we're even.

413
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,644
My position does not allow me
to live indebted to others.

414
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,149
Sure. Now we're even then.

415
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,693
You didn't even realize you got hurt.

416
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,154
Are you always this dull?

417
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,741
You saw how chaotic it was.

418
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,370
I can feel the pain only once I'm relaxed.

419
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,996
What is your name?

420
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,581
Eun-jo, of the Hong family.

421
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,333
Sir.

422
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,044
Why do you ask?

423
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:47,963
Because I'm curious.

424
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,675
Why did you come here?

425
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,222
I wish I knew that too.

426
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,517
Are you here for another apology--

427
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,643
No.

428
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,355
I said I was not interested
in your impulses anymore.

429
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,898
I see.

430
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,360
It seems to be fine silk.

431
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,612
I will return it later.

432
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,533
What's that?

433
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,704
We received some medicinal herbs
from Grand Prince Dowol.

434
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,580
So I was making a list of them.

435
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,915
I see.

436
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,750
Grand Prince Dowol.

437
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,754
Actually, that's why I'm here.

438
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,392
Dig up every bit of dirt on Im Sa-hyeong.

439
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,601
Yes, my lord.

440
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,371
What on earth made you so angry
that you made this mess?

441
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,249
Do you know how much these are worth?

442
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,084
Answer me!

443
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,756
I'm still talking.

444
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,342
Where are you going?

445
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,095
-My head hurts.
-My lady.

446
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,682
-Clean that up.
-Yes, my lady.

447
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,533
Everything from here to there
was sent by Grand Prince Dowol.

448
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,120
I'll make sure His Highness knows
they arrived safely.

449
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,164
Continue what you were doing.

450
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,919
You must be close to the Grand Prince.

451
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,922
You're even carrying out
a secret inspection for His Highness.

452
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,673
We are very close.

453
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,551
I hear he's handsome.

454
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,887
What do you think?

455
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,013
What?

456
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,140
Those rumors are accurate.

457
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,685
What else did you hear?
Tell me everything.

458
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,980
That he's an idler
who's always roaming about,

459
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,107
and that he's a scoundrel.

460
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,278
That must be to explore the world
and broaden his horizons.

461
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,696
What else…

462
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,117
I heard he was a philanderer
who changes women every other day.

463
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,701
Now that's completely untrue.

464
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,911
It's his first!

465
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,165
First?

466
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,503
Am I making excuses for him?

467
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,967
That was inconsiderate of me.

468
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,386
I should have watched my words.

469
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,640
That I'm making excuses
means that I'm bothered.

470
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,351
You're close to him.
Of course you're bothered.

471
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,436
No.

472
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,730
I wasn't until now.

473
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,940
No matter what others say.

474
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,568
Pardon?

475
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,278
What does this mean?

476
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,240
Is everything sorted now?

477
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,786
These herbs are a token
of the Grand Prince's kind heart.

478
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,872
They shall not be wasted.

479
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,498
Yes, sir.

480
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,209
Superintendent, you've seen through
the Grand Prince's goodwill.

481
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,589
Grim Reaper?

482
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,091
Who are you?

483
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,136
He is…

484
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,262
Never mind.

485
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,973
I have no wish to exchange greetings

486
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,768
with a philanderer who keeps
someone's precious daughter at his side

487
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,603
in broad daylight.

488
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,066
Philanderer?

489
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,528
You may not understand,

490
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,281
but there's something hidden
in that picture

491
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,657
that you must never find out.

492
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,451
In other words, it's a misunderstanding.

493
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,411
What is a misunderstanding?

494
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,038
The lady wouldn't have hidden her face

495
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,791
if there were nothing to be ashamed of.

496
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,834
I don't care if you misunderstand me,

497
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,211
but there's nothing between us.

498
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,254
I see.

499
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,257
I know the face. I've seen it.

500
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,592
You don't believe me.

501
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,637
That's not important right now.

502
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,639
It is now.

503
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,475
What?

504
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,981
I don't know anything
about his private life.

505
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,527
Please do not judge him
solely by what you see.

506
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,238
He even helped me just a while ago.

507
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,991
And aside from that,
he serves at the constabulary.

508
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,202
So that speaks to his integrity.

509
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,249
I was wondering where you went.

510
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,671
If you've seen one, you've seen them all.

511
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,258
I forbid you

512
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,717
from entering my Hyeminseo.

513
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,013
Forbid me?

514
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:55,979
He forbade me.

515
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,107
How did you stand me all this time?

516
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,984
I can't stand this though.

517
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,863
I will tell him the truth
and hold him accountable.

518
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,406
Just leave it.

519
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,825
-Pardon?
-We can't say it now.

520
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,119
It'll only prove that I'm a philanderer.

521
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,871
Yes, Your Highness.

522
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,335
By the way,
the female physician from earlier,

523
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,462
she seemed somewhat familiar.

524
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,384
He serves at the constabulary.

525
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,846
Have I ever mentioned the constabulary?

526
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,064
The realgar antidote
we've received from the envoy

527
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,858
should take effect.

528
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,453
Your skin affliction
never seems to improve.

529
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,123
I'm tired.

530
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,777
It'll relieve the pain.

531
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,781
Get some sleep.

532
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,942
When did you get here?

533
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,945
I came straight from the Hyeminseo.

534
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,448
The lady urgently requested the tonic.

535
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,370
What's all this?

536
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,039
The lord had a fit of temper.

537
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,458
So I picked out the things
that could still be put to use.

538
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,880
What are you going to use
the burnt book for?

539
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,425
For the privy.

540
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,052
Like this.

541
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,200
This was in his room?

542
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,702
I was told

543
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,663
that you donated medicinal herbs
to the Hyeminseo.

544
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,331
Yes, it just happened that way.

545
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,584
Just as with Gil-dong.

546
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,088
I see now
that you care deeply for the people.

547
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,716
For the people?

548
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,968
Do you think I did it for the people?

549
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,678
Then what was it for?

550
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,139
It makes me look cool.

551
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,101
I must get going.

552
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,313
Playing constable is getting boring now.

553
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,815
I might start hanging around
the Ministry of Taxation.

554
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,069
Aren't you tired of always roaming around?

555
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,363
Those who are idle
are always the busiest, after all.

556
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,365
Your Highness. I remember now.

557
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,909
The female physician from earlier,

558
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,869
she's the one
you were waiting for that night.

559
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,037
The bandit.

560
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,705
You realize that now?

561
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,458
That said, I have a question.

562
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,835
I keep making excuses--

563
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,178
Please wait here. I'll take a look.

564
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,062
A cotton-tipped arrow?

565
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,815
Gil-dong.

566
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,322
So, you want to talk to me in private.

567
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,632
Is this the Chief Censor's…

568
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,218
This was in his room?

569
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,720
It was burning in the brazier,
so I took it out.

570
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,813
How could this be?

571
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,360
If this comes to light,
can I bear the consequences?

572
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,363
It could put everyone in danger.

573
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,074
Why? What does it say?

574
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,995
It's perfect for privies.

575
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,549
I will allow you
to look after your neighbors your way.

576
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,847
Actually, I've always wanted
to read this book.

577
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,432
Can I have it?

578
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,561
All the corrupt acts he has committed

579
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,022
since serving as the governor
of Pyongan Province

580
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,941
are recorded in great detail.

581
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,322
I understand why you gave this to me.

582
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,616
But didn't I tell you

583
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,618
that I will not support your theft

584
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,954
nor will I blame Joseon
for ignoring corrupt officials?

585
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,497
And by that, I meant…

586
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,834
I would do nothing.

587
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,421
If you thought I was a good man
after seeing one kind act,

588
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,631
you are mistaken.

589
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm not the kind of person
who makes a show of justice.

590
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,094
If you do not wish
to die before your time,

591
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,139
stick to your petty theft
for your neighbors, nothing more.

592
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,017
Bringing down a single corrupt official
will not change this country.

593
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,062
Who's there?

594
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,442
Let him go.

595
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,694
Who was it?

596
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,613
It was Gil-dong.

597
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,829
Is this note from Gil-dong?

598
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,710
It seems like it's a message for you.

599
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,922
"Thank you for last night."

600
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,342
"I came across this book by chance."

601
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,398
I suppose I made too much
of one random kind act.

602
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,484
"I believe it will be of more use to you

603
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,987
than to me, a mere thief."

604
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,199
"A mere thief"?

605
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,285
What's the matter?

606
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,246
He's a mere thief, he says.

607
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,831
Pardon?

608
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,541
Why so eager?

609
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,877
Why always step forward
as if it were your problem?

610
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,629
You're a mere thief.

611
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,881
How annoying.

612
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,014
What is that?

613
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,142
I need to meet him.

614
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,686
Why that look?

615
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,479
Whom do you wish to meet?

616
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,189
My brother.

617
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,957
I pay my respects, Your Majesty.

618
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,126
It's good to see you, my brother.

619
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,092
How long has it been?

620
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,762
The night of the Gyeongo Year
was the last time.

621
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,391
It feels like yesterday

622
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,268
when you pointed

623
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,936
your sword at me that night.

624
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,568
Very well.

625
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,405
Whom will you point at today?

626
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,806
It's handwritten.

627
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,683
I came across it
while I was at the constabulary.

628
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,686
And the crimes listed there have been
confirmed to be true by the aides.

629
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,148
You could've handled it
within the constabulary.

630
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,276
If I submit a petition,
the Chief Censor will move to stop it

631
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,195
before it goes public.

632
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,573
So you wish me to punish him
before the eyes of all.

633
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,121
What if I choose not to act as you wish?

634
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,288
I have no particular wish.

635
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,332
And I shall not.

636
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,001
Your Majesty knows this well.

637
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,922
How heartless of you.

638
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,925
You once discussed marriage
with this family.

639
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,428
Having a greedy father-in-law

640
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,762
will bring me down anyway.

641
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,933
I know you would call it justice,

642
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,272
but what's your real intention?

643
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:43,941
Blast.

644
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,652
I don't want to be ashamed of myself

645
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,612
in front of this man

646
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,114
who is nobody.

647
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,617
What?

648
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,869
That's right.

649
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,328
I know it's childish,

650
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,122
but he hurt my pride.

651
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,093
Why did you meet His Majesty?

652
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,934
I suppose I must go to His Majesty
if I wish to see you

653
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,228
because you never allow me
into your chamber.

654
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,439
How could you…

655
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,901
Tell me.

656
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,278
What did His Majesty say?

657
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,405
Tell me!

658
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,866
Can't you see your mother is worried sick?

659
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,344
This is why

660
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,221
I must be idle even more.

661
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,606
He said he's ashamed of himself.

662
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,653
At least I can spare my younger brother
what little pride he has left.

663
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,656
For the sake of my dignity,
as his brother.

664
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,493
Eun-jo!

665
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,206
No one here knows how to read.

666
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,457
She's here.

667
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,212
Give me a moment.

668
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,468
What does it say?

669
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,595
Come on.

670
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,222
Read it out for us.

671
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,892
Sure.

672
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,815
"Chief Censor Kim Deok-han

673
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,278
extorted the property of the people,

674
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,905
already impoverished
by the continued famine…"

675
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,157
What is all this about?

676
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,294
"…seized their land
through ruthless usury,

677
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,754
eventually driving them to destitution."

678
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,175
"This truly goes against
basic human morality."

679
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,888
"The seized land

680
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:24,393
shall be returned to the peasants
to right the wrongs."

681
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,563
"His office and property
shall be confiscated,

682
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,815
and he is sentenced to exile
pursuant to the law."

683
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,403
"This is to punish

684
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,780
-a corrupt official…
-…a corrupt official

685
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,949
for plundering the people's granary."

686
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,577
My word!

687
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,997
It's like sweet rain after a long drought!

688
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,667
The world
has not entirely turned against us!

689
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,223
What is this?

690
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,935
Maybe it wasn't
just one act of kindness after all.

691
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,372
STATE TRIBUNAL

692
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,083
How dare you?

693
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,670
I asked how the Grand Prince
obtained the book.

694
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,674
You betrayed me,
and now you lay the blame on me?

695
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,388
So the Chief Censor did not
hand the ledger to the Grand Prince?

696
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,643
The Chief Censor may be foolish,
but he would not have destroyed himself.

697
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,561
But no one

698
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,439
is aware of the ledger,
save you and me, Father.

699
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,067
You should quietly sound out
how much His Highness knows.

700
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,947
His Highness does not yet know
the ledger was mine.

701
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,115
Had he known,

702
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,284
it would not have been
only the Chief Censor who was dismissed.

703
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,622
Put a man on the Grand Prince.

704
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,834
Find out whom he meets and where he goes.

705
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,836
Observe his every move.

706
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,760
So, this is it!

707
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,887
Oh, dear. It smells delightful.

708
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,931
Seok-sam, hurry over.

709
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,560
Seok-sam is here!

710
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,603
Chil-seok, what are you doing? Come here.

711
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,938
-Come here.
-Come quickly.

712
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:36,066
Take this, Seok-sam.

713
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,277
I'll drink from the bottle.

714
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,821
-Come on. Let's drink together.
-Let's drink.

715
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,284
Please at least go
and share a drink with them.

716
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,495
They think you're an aide
and wish to show their gratitude

717
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,457
with the food they've made
despite their humble circumstances.

718
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,294
I usually make sure
to take credit for what I do,

719
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,046
but I'll be busy tonight.

720
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,305
-Dae-chu, you go in my stead.
-Me?

721
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,765
Meet me around 8:00 in the evening
at the gate.

722
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,142
And you,

723
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,436
from tomorrow,
keep watch on Gil-dong's movements.

724
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,562
May I ask why?

725
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,315
The Chief Censor's crimes
listed in the ledger

726
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,443
are not something
a petty thief could have gathered.

727
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,488
Do you think someone is behind Gil-dong?

728
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,198
Whether someone stands behind him

729
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,492
or he came upon it by chance, as he wrote,

730
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,784
I must find out.

731
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,952
Yes, Your Highness.

732
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,164
And now I am curious

733
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,209
to see his face.

734
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,614
She's being sold
as our grandfather's concubine.

735
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,533
She will be a caretaker.

736
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,538
Does life treat you well?

737
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,752
I apologize

738
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,256
for my rudeness the other day.
I didn't know you were their second son.

739
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,549
Please forgive me.

740
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,430
I will make his daughter's life miserable

741
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,141
the moment she sets foot in this house.

742
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,229
I will consider

743
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,647
my apology accepted.

744
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,815
Now, if you'll excuse me.

745
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,193
Call off the wedding.

746
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,196
My wedding?

747
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,410
May I ask why?

748
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,412
I cannot stomach

749
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,581
living in this house with those animals.

750
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,085
I will keep it in mind.

751
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,091
In Joseon, carrying a concubine's blood
means you're flawed.

752
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,092
And that means

753
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,095
someone like you will be treated
like an animal in this family.

754
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,265
I do know that much.

755
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,558
No.

756
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,143
You don't know.

757
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,186
Remember this humiliation.

758
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:22,024
Once you set foot in this family,
you will feel it tenfold.

759
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:26,570
My brother has a temper like none other.

760
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,365
Is this a warning?

761
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,576
Call it charity.

762
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,911
Sometimes, I can act like a good man too.

763
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,080
Why are you doing this to me?

764
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,666
Lord Hong sent back all the wedding gifts.

765
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,502
He seems to genuinely care
for someone as lowly as you.

766
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,673
My lord did that?

767
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,802
You really care for each other,
like a real father and daughter.

768
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,346
What a pitiful family.

769
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,184
I must see my lord!

770
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,311
Eun-jo.

771
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,104
Not you as well.

772
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,898
Young Master is right.

773
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,608
We could have taken everything.

774
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,860
So what if we lack a bit of shame?

775
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,529
It would have made your life
much more comfortable.

776
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,073
Was it so hard for you?

777
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,746
He said he wouldn't let you
take any more burden.

778
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,833
He said retrieving my slave register

779
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,419
and keeping this house

780
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,506
were burdens you're already bearing,

781
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,717
so he would pay them all back,
little by little.

782
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,970
That's what he said to Chief Secretary Im.

783
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,433
Don't say anything.

784
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,977
If anything, blame me

785
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,147
for being carried away
by the wedding gifts.

786
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,984
It's getting late.
I must go prepare dinner.

787
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,826
I cannot believe this.

788
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,790
How am I supposed to get married now?

789
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,442
Is anyone here?

790
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,664
Where is she?

791
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,524
What are you doing there?

792
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,153
How did you get here?

793
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,655
I was just passing by.

794
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,949
The moon is shining brightly,

795
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,159
and

796
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,411
I have something to reclaim.

797
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,914
Right, the tie.

798
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,333
I washed it and kept it at home.

799
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,710
Give me a second. I'll be right there.

800
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,920
No.

801
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,296
Stay there.

802
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,597
What were you looking at?

803
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,974
Nothing. The night.

804
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,852
I hate the night.

805
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,773
It's calm and still,
as if nothing has happened.

806
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,276
That's why I like about the night.

807
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,034
Especially when I see it
from the roof like this.

808
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,703
From here,

809
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,415
people seem small, houses seem small,

810
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,877
even the palace seems small.

811
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,256
It makes my worries seem small as well.

812
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,634
What are your worries?

813
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,053
I can be kind and be supportive.

814
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,473
No, thank you.

815
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,184
If someone actually showed support,

816
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,187
I would want to give up everything.

817
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,064
Then give it up.

818
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,858
Whatever it is,

819
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,943
you can give it up just this once.

820
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,782
If you want, I can help you give it up.

821
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:50,000
You're talking
as if you know what it's about.

822
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,336
I don't need to know.

823
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,548
Whatever it is,
I have the power to do that.

824
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:07,934
Does that mean
I have some solid backing now?

825
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:13,940
I feel relieved, this much.

826
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,734
Only that much?

827
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,612
It should be bigger than just this much.

828
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,826
Right.

829
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,621
I happened to overhear

830
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,498
that the Chief Censor's case

831
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:33,376
was investigated by the constabulary.

832
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,589
Actually, I've been wondering about this.

833
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,383
How did you know
I was at the constabulary?

834
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,304
I don't remember saying it.

835
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,729
Well…

836
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,652
It tastes delightful.

837
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,820
What's this about?

838
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,989
You said you wouldn't see us
till you pass the exam.

839
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,158
Congratulations.

840
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,369
Let's forget the other day and move on.

841
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,622
Nothing happened at home?

842
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,706
What do you mean?

843
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,832
Your lowly sister.

844
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,377
Don't talk about that girl.

845
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,336
It kills my appetite.

846
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,796
What?

847
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,633
What happened to all that praise for her?

848
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,053
What's wrong? You don't look well.

849
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,643
Almost all the patients

850
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,938
who come to the Hyeminseo
after being struck by arrows at night

851
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,817
are patrol officers from the constabulary.

852
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:40,819
That makes sense.

853
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,738
So I assumed you were
from the constabulary too.

854
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,995
I heard about the rice
you sent Lady Dong-ju as well.

855
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,579
You know the widow too?

856
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:52,914
How?

857
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,583
The Chief Censor
often laid hands on others.

858
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:59,212
So his slaves frequented the Hyeminseo.

859
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,590
I'm not surprised.

860
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,052
Thank you.

861
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,638
Why would you say that?

862
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,974
Because

863
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,101
I know them pretty well too.

864
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,773
An idler like me
doesn't deserve any thanks.

865
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,358
You should thank someone else.

866
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,861
Who?

867
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:23,987
You don't know him.

868
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,282
There's this man
who is just as nosy as you.

869
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,493
He's talking about Gil-dong.

870
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,747
All I did was make sure
his heart came across.

871
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,920
Your wish for his heart to come across

872
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,422
shows your own heart.

873
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,965
I told you, that's not it.

874
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,969
To me, you seem like a good person.

875
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,221
You must not know yourself very well.

876
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,682
Or are you just pretending?

877
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,812
You haven't known me
long enough to say that.

878
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,067
I can tell
from years of dealing with people.

879
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,862
In any case,

880
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,865
I'm so glad that you solved this case.

881
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,492
How fortunate.

882
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,452
"Fortunate"?

883
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,704
What do you mean by that?

884
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,165
I mean

885
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,877
you're so smart

886
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,296
and everything went well. That's all.

887
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,215
Don't say that so easily.

888
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,382
Pardon?

889
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,134
Poverty, misery,

890
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,552
sadness and tears.

891
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,388
It sounds like I might be
one of the few fortunate things

892
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,891
among all that misfortune you have.

893
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,566
All I said was that it was fortunate.

894
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,693
Follow me.

895
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,280
I don't have the tie, but I will
change the cloth around your wound.

896
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,492
Come, before the Superintendent
kicks you out.

897
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,620
No one's getting kicked out.

898
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,707
Jae-i.

899
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,961
Let's have one more drink.

900
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,422
Let go.

901
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,598
It's the Hyeminseo.

902
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,685
All right.

903
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,981
I will teach the wench a lesson today!

904
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,865
As I said many times,

905
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,409
bans, orders, permissions, aid,

906
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,119
those are things that only I can do.

907
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,704
I was just joking.

908
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,248
You won't be kicked out, so don't worry.

909
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,417
I have no such worry.

910
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,837
If the Superintendent finds out
who he banned from entering,

911
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,422
he will be devastated.

912
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,840
That's what I worry about.

913
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,301
You keep saying that.

914
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,554
So you're from a family
with that much power?

915
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,264
One of the most powerful in Joseon.

916
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,849
That's all you need to know for now.

917
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:01,352
And I'm keeping this from you
so you don't get too shocked.

918
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,607
So I treated someone so great
like a dullard.

919
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,066
It must have felt really unfair.

920
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:08,943
It felt unfamiliar.

921
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,948
It felt unfamiliar
to see a woman less than half my size

922
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,826
standing in front of me to protect me.

923
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,913
This madman doesn't know what he is doing.

924
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,040
Please show the generosity of a nobleman.

925
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,084
So I was intrigued.

926
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,758
And ever since then…

927
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,307
This is nonsense.

928
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,643
There really is such a thing?

929
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,063
What do you mean?

930
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,493
Why are you looking at me like that?
You're embarrassing me.

931
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,827
I feel the same.

932
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,538
I'm embarrassed as well.

933
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:02,956
Pardon?

934
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,584
What I'm about to say
is even more embarrassing.

935
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,379
Is there a man you hold dear?

936
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,300
Why do you ask?

937
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,718
I don't care if you do.

938
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,262
Are you free tomorrow?

939
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,429
Make some time for me.

940
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,140
What are you doing?

941
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,225
I'm courting you.

942
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,606
From now on,

943
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,733
I want to do it more properly.

944
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:40,994
Well…

945
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,042
I'm getting married soon…

946
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,050
How did you…

947
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,436
What is this?

948
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,730
A man and a woman

949
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,523
at this late hour?

950
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,402
Who is that man?

951
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,862
Introduce yourself first.

952
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,494
Give me a moment.

953
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,749
What's the matter?

954
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,962
You seem flustered.

955
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,589
This is interesting.

956
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,594
Am I seeing what I'm not supposed to see?

957
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,221
Pardon?

958
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,435
This is clearly a tryst.

959
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,271
And an uninvited guest
has arrived at just the right time.

960
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,609
Does he know that

961
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,528
you're marrying a man in his 70s?

962
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,249
Your face is getting
more and more interesting.

963
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,712
It will be even more interesting
if he finds out.

964
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,508
Hey.

965
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,896
You tell me.

966
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,148
Who do you think

967
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,275
I am?

968
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,544
I hope this is the last time we meet.

969
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,670
Should I steal her?

970
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,046
I'm the Grand Prince.

971
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,840
I can steal whatever I want.

972
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,384
Broken heart? Is it really that hard?

973
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,761
Call off the wedding.

974
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,220
Do you want to be sold that badly?

975
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,765
A fight for survival,

976
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,768
like you said, for a lowly girl like me.

977
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,269
Be honest with me.

978
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,188
You're avoiding me now.

979
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,606
You haven't known me that long.

980
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,191
How much longer do you need

981
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,525
to understand me?

982
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,152
I just need you to say one thing.

983
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,070
That it's all right.

984
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,156
