1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,967
They say it's like
a cloud swallowing the moon.

2
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,677
So that's when he shows up?

3
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,845
No.

4
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,640
That's how long it takes him
to rob a single storehouse.

5
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,768
So did you see him?

6
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,479
Indeed, I did.

7
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,857
The moment the cloud released the moon.

8
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,402
He was a Baekjeong!

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,363
It's the return
of Im Kkeok-jeong's spirit!

10
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,615
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,492
I heard he had a sharp, handsome nose,

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,703
and he's the prettiest man in Joseon.

13
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,954
That way!

14
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,957
What the heck? It's not a human.

15
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,877
It's a monster with fur all over its body.

16
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,130
What?

17
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,299
I thought he was a 100-year-old hermit.

18
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,096
Does a 100-year-old have the energy

19
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,724
to distribute ten thousand seok of rice
across the capital?

20
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,934
Oh, really?

21
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:45,355
So this thief is a handsome man
who wants to shack up with a widow?

22
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,106
Watch out for good-looking men.

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,777
Well, it's a monster covered in fur,
with monstrous strength.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,238
Oh, for goodness sake.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,116
-I told you.
-Ma'am.

26
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:00,078
I saw that great, righteous thief
with my own two eyes last night!

27
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,996
He's a Baekjeong.

28
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,751
There's been improvement.

29
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,630
For the next three days,
clean your eyes with salt water

30
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,590
and then rinse them with warm water.

31
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,175
Thanks, Eun-jo.

32
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,343
By the way,

33
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,138
you know eye problems
can affect your vision, right?

34
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,765
A pig?

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,103
I know. A chicken head.

36
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,773
What's that?

37
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,275
A dragon?

38
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,569
Baekjeong, my foot.

39
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,613
Oh, it's a snake head.

40
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,823
It's a chicken head.

41
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,032
Seok-sam, that punk.

42
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,785
His eyes lie just as much as his words do.

43
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,081
These herbs are good
for child malnutrition.

44
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,584
There's no way
he saw this righteous thief.

45
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,962
Well, how can a thief
possibly be righteous?

46
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,797
Do you really think so?

47
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,257
The granaries of corrupt officials

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,302
are filled with things
taken from the people.

49
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,304
Which means those granaries

50
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,763
rightfully belong to the people.

51
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,515
So it isn't theft.

52
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,518
It is merely giving back
what was taken from them.

53
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,395
You heard him.

54
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,399
Are you on the thief's side too, sir?

55
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,362
How could I ever take a thief's side?
I'm only speaking the truth.

56
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,032
Rumors are never wholly true.

57
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,784
So maybe

58
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,078
the name is fake.

59
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,247
The name?

60
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,042
People call him Gil-dong.

61
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,044
"A friend on the road"?

62
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,463
Is that what it means?

63
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,050
Well, some say that
it means "the rope on the ground."

64
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,719
This is a real headache.

65
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,347
The truth is lost amid countless rumors.

66
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,643
-Did I just say…
-Did you just say…

67
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,519
"lost"?

68
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,877
YI YEOL
GRAND PRINCE DOWOL

69
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,130
I told you,

70
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,217
when you're lost in the case,
you can always come to me.

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,554
He has good ears.

72
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,723
It's good to see you again,
Your Highness.

73
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,016
It has been a long time.

74
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,395
That said,

75
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,023
the moral order has collapsed.
This is no small matter.

76
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,027
Please have a seat here.

77
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,198
I know we're both busy,
so let us dispense with formalities.

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,743
And there is no need for thanks.

79
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,497
This isn't the first time I've
shared my wisdom with you thick-heads.

80
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,710
We are deeply grateful
for your constant help

81
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,211
with our investigations.

82
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,884
The great thief
who stole ten thousand seok of rice?

83
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,554
-Who are the victims?
-There are none.

84
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,975
Those crooked officials
couldn't come forward,

85
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,727
afraid their own sins would be exposed.

86
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,520
They just chose not to.

87
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,648
-And I wouldn't either, if I were them.
-Why is that?

88
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,776
Someone reported
that they saw Gil-dong here,

89
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,278
at the Chief Censor's storehouse.

90
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,195
That's right.

91
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,615
One of our slaves
saw something suspicious.

92
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,958
The storehouse is already full again.

93
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,335
The Chief Censor
must be blessed with fortune,

94
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,920
though he doesn't seem like it.

95
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,005
Well, the truth is…

96
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,965
You couldn't find anything stolen.

97
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,010
That's right, sir.
Everything is exactly as it was.

98
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,471
-Search the place.
-Yes, sir.

99
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,648
I found it!

100
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,324
It looks like a bowl of rice.

101
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,952
-Did Gil-dong leave this drawing?
-Yes, Your Highness.

102
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,751
Could it be…

103
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,253
Weigh the rice now.

104
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,220
How much is missing?

105
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,225
One sack should fill an entire jar,
but exactly three does are missing.

106
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,814
That means Gil-dong stole
just three does of rice.

107
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,275
This is why his thefts
were usually discovered much later.

108
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,154
And even when it's discovered,
the amount is too small to report.

109
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,283
Has anyone claimed to have received
the stolen goods from Gil-dong?

110
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,077
Not a single one.

111
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,081
He's just a petty thief
who steals for himself.

112
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,085
And people speak of him
as a righteous thief.

113
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,340
Are there

114
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,509
more of his drawings, like this?

115
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,763
Why does he leave these drawings?

116
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,974
If he didn't, no one would ever notice.

117
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,475
That's what I'm talking about.

118
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,644
It's like he's messing with us.

119
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,937
Well, apparently,

120
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,939
he's proud of his thefts.

121
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,566
Humans, by nature,

122
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,901
affirm their sense of worth
by revealing their strengths.

123
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,988
Oh, I get it.

124
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,157
Just like how you gather
all the court ladies to brag

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,784
every time you solve a case.

126
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,913
It means he's the kind of man
who craves attention as well.

127
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,166
Is that a question or a criticism?

128
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,917
I wouldn't dare. It's a mere question.

129
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
No more questions from now on.

130
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,715
I get why you spread out the drawings.

131
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,928
Gil-dong wants

132
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,806
to brag about his thefts everywhere.

133
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,978
And there are rumors
calling him a righteous thief.

134
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,314
He must be puffed up with pride.

135
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,525
Well, who do you think
started those rumors?

136
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,443
No way.

137
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,195
Gil-dong.

138
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,074
Seize those spreading the rumors.

139
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,118
The false rumors
are covering up the thefts,

140
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,078
so that's where we'll find the culprit.

141
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,371
Yes, Your Highness.

142
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,417
Your Highness,

143
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,378
aren't you supposed to have tea
with the Queen Dowager around 4:00?

144
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,631
Why are you saying that now?

145
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,840
You said no more questions--

146
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,384
Don't you know
how to say things as a statement?

147
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,032
Hey, wake up.

148
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,117
Wake up!

149
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,663
Is His Majesty here?

150
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,248
It's another Majesty!

151
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,374
What?

152
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,001
Your Majesty!

153
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,171
Why did it have to be you?

154
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,382
Couldn't you have made it
more convincing at least?

155
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,009
I'm here to have tea with the Prince,

156
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,221
so you should have made me think,
"My boy is taking a well-deserved nap"

157
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,432
and had me come back another time.

158
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,726
That is what you are here for!

159
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,479
We beg for mercy, Your Majesty!

160
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,651
His Majesty is keeping
a close watch on the Prince.

161
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,320
You people can't protect the Prince.

162
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,328
Send word to my brother that

163
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,163
we must hasten
Yeol's marriage arrangements.

164
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

165
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,148
YI GYU
THE KING OF JOSEON

166
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,402
They're trying to marry Yeol
to the Chief Censor's daughter?

167
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,654
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

168
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,572
If that happens,

169
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,284
the Chief Censor will start
protecting Grand Prince Dowol.

170
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,370
As if everyone's out
to get the Grand Prince.

171
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,080
Her Majesty frets too much.

172
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,542
This is all because I failed
to earn Her Majesty's trust.

173
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,918
It is my fault.

174
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,546
That is not true, Your Majesty.

175
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,131
Secretary Im.

176
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,384
What do you think I should do
to appease Her Majesty?

177
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,221
IM SA-HYEONG
CHIEF ROYAL SECRETARY

178
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,559
I have a family in mind
for Grand Prince Dowol's marriage.

179
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,811
The Commander-in-Chief in Goryeo--

180
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,396
I'm sure you know what you're doing.

181
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,150
It's my younger brother's marriage,
so see to it personally.

182
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,914
A military clan from Goryeo?
I wonder what they're doing now.

183
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,209
They must be growing rice
somewhere in the countryside.

184
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,837
What a sly fox you are.

185
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,215
If I'm a fox, what are you, Geum-nok?

186
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,759
GEUM-NOK
SUK-YONG

187
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm a nine-tailed fox, of course.

188
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,277
Your Majesty.

189
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,156
SHIN YEO-GYEONG
QUEEN CONSORT

190
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,827
I hear my niece and
the Chief Secretary's son got engaged.

191
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,828
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,997
The Im family is seeking to expand
its influence through marriage ties.

193
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,460
Everyone knows their scheme,
yet there is no one to stop it.

194
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,045
It is truly grievous.

195
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,881
Oh, Geum-nok!

196
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,556
It tickles, Your Majesty!

197
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,767
I am deeply sorry

198
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,895
that such grievous misfortunes
keep befalling Your Majesty.

199
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,940
But please do not be disheartened.

200
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,235
My son will will look after your niece

201
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,487
with the greatest care.

202
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,074
IM JAE-I
IM SA-HYEONG'S SECOND SON

203
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,544
THE TALE OF SUKHYANG

204
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,256
SHIN HAE-RIM
THE QUEEN CONSORT'S NIECE

205
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,306
They call this erotic?

206
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,600
It's too bland.

207
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,445
Well.

208
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,572
It looks like we're really destined.

209
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,199
Pardon?

210
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,537
I didn't expect to meet my fiancée here.

211
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,708
Wait, are you…

212
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,419
My father is the Chief Royal Secretary.

213
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,966
This is the woman who is to be my wife.
Pay your respects.

214
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,218
Hello, I'm No-eul.

215
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,012
And this woman here will be my concubine.

216
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,014
No, maybe you already are.

217
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,602
If we went by who undressed first,
I would be the consort,

218
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,522
but I'll let you have that place.

219
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,902
It's great to see my wives get along.

220
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,488
Now that we're all here,
why don't we have a drink?

221
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,865
We'll be family.

222
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,408
That sounds lovely.

223
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,872
I should get going.
My brother is probably waiting for me.

224
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,217
Why don't you marry her,
instead of tormenting that lovely woman?

225
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,468
Marriage is a gamble.

226
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,722
-I want to win far more than what I stake.
-What?

227
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,349
In this country, from kings to slaves,

228
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,645
everyone uses marriage
to secure wealth, honor, power,

229
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,980
and higher status.

230
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,191
So I might as well play for higher stakes.

231
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,778
She's the Queen Consort's niece.
What could possibly be a higher stake?

232
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,822
Something like…

233
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,658
love.

234
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,829
How typical.

235
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,082
You highborn are all the same.

236
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,835
Yes, I'm trying to put together
a typical charade.

237
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,547
I have expectations to meet, after all.

238
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,262
Stay healthy, okay?

239
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,139
-Sir.
-Hello.

240
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,433
I'm here to pick up the herbs I asked for.

241
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,976
Sure. Just wait a second.

242
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,244
I'm back, Young Master.

243
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,207
-Wait, stop there.
-Yes?

244
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,045
I told you not to come in
wearing that physician's robe,

245
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,838
reeking of my patients.

246
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,424
I meant to change first,

247
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,969
but things were hectic
at the Hyeminseo today.

248
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,597
Do you think bringing home some money
suddenly makes you someone?

249
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,932
But I'm your family's slave.

250
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,517
-So what?
-What do you mean?

251
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,310
Could a slave be someone?

252
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,272
-Of course not.
-Exactly.

253
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,607
Right.

254
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,987
You're just being mean for no reason.

255
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,281
How dare you talk back to me?

256
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,457
Where did she go?

257
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,418
Mother!

258
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,401
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

259
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,654
I know you're tired. Give it to me.

260
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,327
Look at how dirty
the young master's socks are.

261
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,747
Is he secretly seeing a woman
at night or what?

262
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,209
Don't say that. He's not even married.

263
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,838
I'll hang them.

264
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,757
You go back and take the medicine.

265
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,966
Let's do it together.

266
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,094
Come on.
You need to take it while it's hot.

267
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,471
Come on.

268
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,900
HONG MIN-JIK
HONG EUN-JO'S FATHER

269
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,985
Eun-jo, come to my room.

270
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,200
What is it you wish to say, my lord?

271
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,913
You can call me "Father" at home,
as I said.

272
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,917
How can I? I'm a concubine's daughter.

273
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,086
People would point fingers at you
if they heard that.

274
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,639
What is this?

275
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,768
From now on, wear these
whenever you go to Secretary Im's house.

276
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,563
Where did you get the money
to buy the silk clothes?

277
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,690
No, actually,

278
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,444
why would you want me to wear these
when I go to his house?

279
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,489
You must be aware

280
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,574
that his eldest son
has taken no concubine.

281
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,621
We will have your wedding soon.

282
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,418
I humbly beg you, please call it off.

283
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,756
I wish to live here with you and Mother
for the rest of my life.

284
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,509
My foolish child.

285
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:59,304
No parent would wish their child
to grow old alone.

286
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,057
It's time for you to live a woman's life.

287
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,185
I have never wanted a woman's life.

288
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,736
You have suffered enough in this house.

289
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,655
You have had enough.

290
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,579
You may be a concubine's child,

291
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,123
but I wish them to treat you with respect.

292
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,875
That's why I prepared these.

293
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,334
So be sure to wear them.

294
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,644
The officer at the constabulary
will be reprimanded.

295
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,107
Why not first fault the Prince

296
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,693
for lingering about the constabulary?

297
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,989
It was all for the security of the capital

298
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,576
and ultimately,
for the people and you as well, Mother.

299
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,744
Don't worry about me.

300
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,664
From now on,
live for one woman, not for me.

301
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:17,007
Marry the Chief Censor's daughter.
His family will be a great support to you.

302
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,435
Yes, Mother.

303
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,813
So you're doing it?

304
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,858
But let me meet her first.

305
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,194
I need to know about her personality.

306
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,155
I want to see if she's reliable,
and most of all,

307
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,406
if she's beautiful.

308
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,368
No, that is not how it's done.

309
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,955
I guess Gil-dong robbing that house
wasn't for nothing after all.

310
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,920
Have you made any progress
in catching that thief, Gil-dong?

311
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,257
I heard he robbed your storehouse too,
so I've been keeping a close eye on it.

312
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,427
I'm so relieved to hear that,
Your Highness.

313
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,519
Please excuse the humble refreshments.
I didn't expect your visit today.

314
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,231
The refreshments at our palace
pale in comparison to this.

315
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,527
So I had a look around the storehouse,

316
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,904
and I couldn't quite see…

317
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,906
Now, I see it.

318
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,912
This is my daughter.

319
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,956
Pay your respects.

320
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,541
This is Grand Prince Dowol.

321
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,335
I am Jin, of the Kim Family.

322
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,088
-Does your name "Jin" mean "beauty"?
-Yes, Your Highness.

323
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,173
My name is Yi Yeol.
"Yeol" means "happiness."

324
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,427
It seems like the two of us
are living up to our names.

325
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,572
Why don't we go hunting together sometime?

326
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,450
I was sheltered,
can't stand anything rough.

327
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,035
Stabbing, killing…

328
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,370
anything involving blood
just doesn't appeal to me.

329
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,125
Is that something you fancy?

330
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,920
As a woman,
I certainly do not fancy seeing blood.

331
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,255
What a shame.

332
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,008
Because that's what you need
to become a Grand Prince's wife.

333
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,011
Rivalry and intrigue are fundamental
to life in the royal court.

334
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,097
-Your Highness.
-There's no need for pretense.

335
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,807
It will only embarrass us both.

336
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,937
If you give birth to a prince,

337
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,023
he would be deemed a threat
to the crown prince.

338
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,067
You may witness your child poisoned,

339
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,277
or murdered under the guise of suicide.

340
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,322
But I suppose you know that much.

341
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,700
-In case of a conspiracy--
-Your Highness.

342
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,994
Your words can be heard beyond the fence.

343
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,829
Even if, after a bloody power struggle,

344
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,124
I were to ascend the throne
and you were to become Queen Consort,

345
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,376
you would soon be deposed.

346
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,713
And why would that be?

347
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,925
Your family may be wealthy,

348
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,676
but it holds no real power.

349
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,055
I don't think your family
can guard the Queen's palace.

350
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,473
But Your Highness--

351
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,683
A king cannot be a husband.

352
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,228
A king doesn't protect his woman.

353
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,648
He protects his throne.

354
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,317
Your father must know.

355
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,113
Because he is the one
who deposed His Majesty's mother.

356
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,497
Why did you refuse
the Chief Secretary's daughter?

357
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,542
Brother!

358
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,294
Come now.

359
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,630
I told you not to call me Brother.

360
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,714
Yes, Your Highness.

361
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,803
But why can I not call you Brother?
You are my brother.

362
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,517
Because our mother isn't my mother.

363
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,813
My birth mother is the deposed queen,
cast out of the palace

364
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,356
by political strife.

365
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,610
Do you understand what this means, Yeol?

366
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,823
It means you and I are enemies.

367
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,620
So, Yeol,

368
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,373
keep your brilliance
hidden from the world.

369
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,627
Keep yourself from my sight,
and do nothing,

370
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,296
unless

371
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,465
you want to lose your mother like me.

372
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,345
I could not protect my mother,

373
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,223
but you must protect yours.

374
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,772
To me, marriage is

375
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,691
a place of refuge.

376
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,860
Do you wish to go into hiding?

377
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,322
I must remain as unnoticed as possible.

378
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,409
Well, you certainly want to remain
unnoticed by Her Majesty today.

379
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,913
Do you think she'll kill me?

380
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,664
She definitely will, right?

381
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,544
Oh, my goodness!

382
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,671
Your Highness.

383
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,382
I'm so sorry!

384
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,675
Am I dead already?

385
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,055
I'm smelling death.

386
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,184
Dae-chu, what's this hole for?

387
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,852
Is it for breathability?

388
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,313
It's just ragged.

389
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,522
What?

390
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,859
They were the only clothes I could borrow.
Since we were rushing…

391
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,613
I am not going anywhere looking like this.

392
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,116
If you make me wear these rags
for more than an hour,

393
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,743
you will pay dearly for it.

394
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,830
I'll run to the palace and be right back!

395
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,148
-Did you see my grandfather?
-Yes, sir.

396
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:12,862
My father says my grandfather's bedsores
and complexion have improved greatly

397
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,864
since you began treating him.

398
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,119
I'm just doing
what I have been doing back in Hyeminseo.

399
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,290
Give her a little more
than her usual fee today.

400
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,416
Yes, sir.

401
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,711
Excuse me, sir.

402
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,676
About our marriage…

403
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,138
One.

404
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,098
One.

405
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,392
One.

406
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,728
One.

407
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,746
How dare a lowlife like you
speak to me like that?

408
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,956
Do I look like a lowlife to you?

409
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,126
Even filthy water and ragged clothes

410
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,920
cannot conceal my nobility
and elegant bearing.

411
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,048
This rude wretch!

412
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,593
Look, you keep calling me wretch.

413
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,886
You wretch!

414
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,429
Are you asking for trouble?

415
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,271
You must have really lost your mind.

416
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,858
This is against the moral order.
Come with me to the constabulary.

417
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,861
My goodness. That mad wretch
is earning himself a hundred lashes.

418
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,947
That mad slave is digging his own grave.

419
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,450
Follow me.

420
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,745
What?

421
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:46,998
Let go of me.

422
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,541
Let me lead the way.

423
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,044
As a matter of fact,
I frequent the constabulary.

424
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,338
So let me lead the way.

425
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,841
It seems like
I need to beat some sense into you!

426
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,283
Where did he go?

427
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,495
Who are you?

428
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,874
Sir,

429
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,585
please do not soil your noble hands.

430
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,546
This man is a slave.

431
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,089
A slave?

432
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,883
This is none of your concern.

433
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,514
He's right. Please step back, my lady.

434
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,642
This madman doesn't know what he is doing.

435
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,019
Please show the generosity of a nobleman.

436
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,607
A nobleman's generosity
isn't for lowly slaves.

437
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,988
It is thanks to lowly slaves
who till the land and harvest the crops

438
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,907
that you can wear such fine clothes

439
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,869
and appear so well-fed
and radiant as you do.

440
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,371
And if this slaves dies,

441
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,914
who's going to feed the cows?

442
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,002
Is he from your household, my lady?

443
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,253
"My lady"?

444
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:16,963
Oh, "my lady."

445
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,715
Right. Yes.

446
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,176
He is my slave.

447
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,677
Who? Me?

448
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,680
Ever since

449
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,517
my grandfather passed away,
our family fell on hard times.

450
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,770
So every hand we have is precious.

451
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,147
But then he fell from a pear tree

452
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,232
and completely lost his mind.

453
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,735
So I always have to keep an eye on him.

454
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,656
I bet it's a lot of work.

455
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,869
My apologies. Please punish me instead.

456
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,916
No, that wouldn't be necessary.

457
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,251
Of course, it isn't.

458
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,089
Don't apologize without my permission.

459
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,883
Especially when it's on my behalf.

460
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,471
No one would dare punish me.

461
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,475
Also, I'm not anyone's slave--

462
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,648
What happened to my knees?

463
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,235
Who did this to my knees?

464
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,365
Did you kick me to my knees?

465
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,702
Look. I'm this country's--

466
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,374
He's been saying

467
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,835
he's possessed by a general's spirit
for the past few days.

468
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,921
And he keeps yelling like this.

469
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,215
Be quiet.

470
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,051
Does this slave
really belong to your family?

471
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,594
Yes.

472
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,555
He does.

473
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,265
He's my slave girl…

474
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,182
-Girl?
-Girl?

475
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,600
Slave boy!

476
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,602
Boy. He's my slave boy.

477
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,187
Slave boy?

478
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,482
Hello, Seung-baek.

479
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,735
Young Master?

480
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,696
If they find out I'm a slave, I'm done.

481
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,366
Thank you for forgiving us.
Now, please excuse us.

482
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,247
Let go.
I do not want you to regret anything.

483
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,584
Please, I don't want
to be beaten to death.

484
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,669
-Death?
-Yes. Come on. Let's go.

485
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,672
What's all this fuss about?

486
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,633
It was some madman.

487
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,429
He looks familiar.

488
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,819
Will you let go now?
I don't think they're following us.

489
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,489
Why did you run?

490
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,992
Well, my young master…

491
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,162
Wait a minute.

492
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,622
You know I saved your life, right?

493
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,540
It's his life that was spared.

494
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,792
Oh, my.

495
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,088
You weren't just pretending
to be a madman.

496
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,173
A madman?

497
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,260
Weren't you pretending to be mad
to escape punishment?

498
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,096
There was no one at the market earlier

499
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,265
who could dare punish me.

500
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,892
This man is seriously mad.

501
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,605
I can't believe how I look either.

502
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,273
I refuse to explain further.

503
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,567
I refuse to help you further too.

504
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,277
-Farewell.
-Not so fast.

505
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,405
There's something I need to know.

506
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,995
What did you mean when you said
you would be beaten to death?

507
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,914
That's why I followed you here,

508
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,791
so you'd better explain.

509
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,542
Of course it means that

510
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,420
once they find out it was a lie,
we would both be punished…

511
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,923
If I tell him I'm a slave as well,

512
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,716
he'll be utterly shocked.

513
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,386
Because you're not my slave.

514
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,222
I was trying to avoid punishment
for my lie. That's what I meant.

515
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,891
So why get involved in the first place?

516
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,187
Your punishment
would not have ended with you.

517
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,107
Your mother, your father
and even your relatives

518
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,733
would have gotten lashes.

519
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,820
What a nosy woman.

520
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,447
I know.

521
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,492
My nosiness is one of the few blessings

522
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,787
I was born with.

523
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,038
I don't like it either.

524
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,374
What are the rest?

525
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,753
Poverty, misery, sadness and tears.

526
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,259
Of all my misfortunes,
the one blessing I have

527
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,468
is my mother.

528
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,604
And my father.

529
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,404
Why is he looking at me like that?

530
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,073
I should stop answering him and go.

531
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:54,991
I'll get going now.

532
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,421
My silk clothes…

533
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,006
I can't let them get wet.

534
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,149
You're quite nimble.

535
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,359
I have never been rained upon in my life.

536
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,696
-You may not believe me, but it's true.
-Sure.

537
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,448
Because, if I were to fall ill,

538
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,492
several physicians
would be held to account.

539
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,495
You may not believe this either,
but it is true.

540
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,662
Sure.

541
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,456
-You don't believe me, do you?
-No.

542
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,356
What are you doing?

543
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,858
I don't want them to get muddy.

544
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,988
These are the first silk shoes and dress
I have ever had.

545
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,200
Is your family that badly off?

546
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,787
Even so, a young lady
shouldn't so easily bare her feet.

547
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,207
What's the big deal?

548
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,932
What are you doing?

549
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,060
You may not know this
because you haven't been rained upon,

550
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,104
but being in the rain,

551
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,190
it feels as though
all your sorrow is washed away.

552
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,901
I don't believe you.

553
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,490
It really does.

554
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,118
You may not believe it though.

555
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,682
Is it rain that just hit my back?

556
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,434
I think it was a thunderbolt.

557
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,522
I wish the thunderbolt hit your mouth too.

558
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,483
It's…

559
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,944
It's so cold. I can't move.

560
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,661
Take it off.

561
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,829
I see what you're doing.

562
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,750
You need to wring the water out of it
so it dries quickly.

563
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,801
Don't be so dramatic. It's just some rain.

564
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,595
This is the first time
cold water has touched my body.

565
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,598
My body has only ever touched
warm water fragrant with flowers.

566
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,520
Well, no one asked you to go stand there.

567
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,730
You said
those were your only silk clothes.

568
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,405
You weren't born with many blessings.

569
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,574
You might as well avoid the rain.

570
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,498
Well…

571
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,834
Thank you.

572
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,462
"Thank you"?
You're supposed to say "I'm honored…"

573
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,305
Pardon me. Did you see a man sitting here?

574
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,766
This is bad. He hates rain.

575
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,820
Do you not know how to do it?

576
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,157
My hands are not meant for tying knots.

577
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,420
You have never been rained upon

578
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,297
nor tied a knot on your jacket.

579
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,631
What do you even do?

580
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,551
Nothing. It's a very important task.

581
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,595
So that's how you lost your mind.

582
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,150
It seems the rain has stopped.

583
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,745
I'm good.

584
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,871
I'm throwing them away.

585
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,166
I will not let that foul-smelling thing
touch my body.

586
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,836
He's a madman.
Let's not waste words on him.

587
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,214
Since you threw them away, I'll take them.

588
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,886
What is your father's name?

589
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,057
Your family may be in decline,
but it still has a name.

590
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,310
Should I just tell him the truth now?

591
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,479
That I'm a slave like him?

592
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,649
Her face has hardened.

593
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,859
Has her family been completely wiped out?

594
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,198
Never mind, if you don't want to say it,
but do this for me.

595
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,035
On the day of the full moon,
come to Soha Village around 6:00.

596
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,081
Why should I do that?

597
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,751
I'd like to offer a generous reward
for your nosiness.

598
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,712
These are enough for me.

599
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,339
Well, then, take care.

600
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,968
They're not enough for me.

601
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,595
And I must

602
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,889
see you

603
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,183
once again.

604
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,479
Please come.

605
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,608
I will.

606
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,828
Reward, my foot.

607
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,291
A reward?

608
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,961
You're getting a punishment
for treating me like a mad slave.

609
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,757
Your Highness, you were here.

610
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,092
It's been over one hour.

611
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,472
Father.

612
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,017
Yes. Come in.

613
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,194
Father, is Eun-jo getting married?

614
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:32,114
That would mean even fewer wages
coming into this house.

615
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,032
Enough.

616
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,783
I heard you even bought her silk clothes.

617
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,327
Where did you get the money?

618
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:41,165
It's the money Eun-jo earned,
which I set aside little by little.

619
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,459
I will sell those silk clothes.

620
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,086
They're bought with a slave's money,
so they're mine.

621
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,214
Get out of my room.

622
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,216
You can't let Eun-jo go!

623
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,258
Get out of my room!

624
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,754
I humbly beg you

625
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,632
to postpone the wedding,
if only for a short while.

626
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,093
I must look after my ailing mother.

627
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,348
And ever since that incident,
my family is still badly off.

628
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,934
We need the money I earn.

629
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,690
I understand what you're saying,
but my grandfather has little time left.

630
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,568
Pardon?

631
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,069
The Old Master, sir?

632
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,613
My father does not wish

633
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,116
his father to meet a lonely death.

634
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,910
So he wanted to get him a concubine
who would look after him.

635
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,248
The man I was to marry was…

636
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,376
the Old Master?

637
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,212
You seem displeased.

638
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,717
Not at all, sir. I beg your pardon.

639
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,346
Make that face again,

640
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,267
and your entire family
will be cast out of that house.

641
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,356
You should be grateful
that your father and I are friends.

642
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,734
I am not like my father.

643
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,944
I would have slain
every living creature in your house

644
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,780
on the very day of the literati purge
if I were him.

645
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,879
Keep a clear head.

646
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,089
This marriage must happen, no matter what.

647
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,177
In Joseon, marriage is a transaction
for everyone.

648
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,472
From the king
down to a concubine's daughter like me.

649
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,141
So I will weigh the terms as well.

650
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,519
One.

651
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,774
One.

652
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,694
One.

653
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,364
One.

654
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,431
Is that the lord?

655
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,975
Not even one nyang?

656
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,520
It took me ten full nights
to transcribe them.

657
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,105
The truth is…

658
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,066
These four books have too many errors.

659
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,485
Is that so?

660
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:00,197
My eyesight has grown dim with age.

661
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,491
Then deduct the errors from the payment.

662
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,661
I'm sorry I couldn't pay you more.

663
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,163
Don't worry. Thank you.

664
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,176
Excuse me, sir. I have a question.

665
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,931
When did the man who just left
start the transcription work?

666
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,100
About a year ago.

667
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,185
A year?

668
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,189
It's good for coughs. Brew it and take it.

669
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,276
How did you get this rare medicine?

670
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,033
He is Lord Hong Min-jik.

671
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:49,580
He spoke harsh truths to the king,
and was swept up in the literati purge.

672
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:53,792
He was stripped of his post,
and all his property was confiscated.

673
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,798
Eun-jo is here, my lord.

674
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,300
Yes, come in.

675
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,185
Are you coming from Secretary Im's house?

676
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,436
You look beautiful.

677
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,021
My lord.

678
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,441
Is the man I am to marry--

679
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,067
You mean, Seung-jae?

680
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,027
What about him?

681
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,154
Just as I thought,

682
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,199
Father does not know
that the marriage is to the Old Master.

683
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,660
He would never imagine
that it could be the Old Master.

684
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,079
Never mind.

685
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,008
I hear he even lives
in someone else's house.

686
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,844
It is a shame that such a great man
met with such a fate.

687
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,804
Make that face again,

688
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:51,517
and your entire family
will be cast out of that house.

689
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:21,171
Your Highness!

690
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,257
Come in.

691
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,221
A message has come from the constabulary.

692
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,808
So they've caught onto Gil-dong.

693
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,560
Gil-dong?

694
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,520
I don't know anything.

695
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,939
I only know him
by what I've heard from others.

696
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,567
If you cannot confess
who you heard it from,

697
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,152
you may be punished as an offender.

698
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:45,988
Pardon?

699
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,993
You cannot be serious, sir.

700
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,120
She's a woman.

701
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,913
She's a widow with a child.

702
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,166
I'm just saying.

703
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,254
Well…

704
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,632
I did see Gil-dong that night.

705
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:10,220
He was jumping from roof to roof.

706
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,555
It can't be her.

707
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,683
You see a tiger and think it's a pig.
What do you know?

708
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,018
What did you say?

709
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,980
Tell me exactly what you saw
without exaggeration.

710
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,693
He's a Baekjeong. I'm sure of it.

711
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,700
What's that?

712
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,206
I saw him only dimly, but I'm sure of it.

713
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,917
He was wearing a Baekjeong's mask?

714
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,670
Farewell, sir.

715
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,505
Wait for me.

716
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,466
Are you sure
you want to let the widow go?

717
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,511
I'm letting her go for a reason.

718
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,309
I saw him only dimly, but I'm sure of it.

719
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,063
You see a tiger and think it's a pig.
What do you know?

720
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,940
They seemed to be hiding Gil-dong.

721
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,985
They must know him.

722
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,863
You.

723
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,783
-You'd better stop running your mouth.
-What?

724
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,910
Well, you know why I ran my mouth.

725
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,620
I said, wait for me.

726
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,916
Prepare a wanted sketch of Gil-dong,
and keep a close watch on the widow.

727
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,876
If we follow her closely,
we'll catch Gil-dong.

728
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,044
Yes, Your Highness.

729
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,339
Are you going back to the palace now?

730
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,591
I have a plan for today.

731
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,343
Please come.

732
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,762
I will.

733
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,809
Soon, it will be time for punishment.

734
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:43,980
Eun-jo!

735
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,401
I'm sorry I'm late.
Something urgently came up.

736
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,322
The baby just fell asleep.

737
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,740
Thank you.

738
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,576
I will see you later at night.
I need to go somewhere.

739
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,911
Very well. I'll see you.

740
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,299
How do you do, my lord?

741
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,260
Yes, Eun-jo.

742
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,140
I have something to say.

743
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,107
My lord. Please step outside.

744
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,202
These are for Eun-jo's wedding.

745
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,960
-Did Chief Secretary Im send these?
-Yes, my lord.

746
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,466
Store them safely
and do not let anyone lay a hand on it.

747
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,349
We will choose an auspicious day

748
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,852
and hold the wedding.

749
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,648
My lord,

750
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,777
all the wedding gifts have been delivered.

751
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,945
Very well.

752
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,033
Lord Hong is not aware

753
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,911
that this marriage is

754
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,287
to the Old Master.

755
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,916
He must have misunderstood what I said.

756
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,045
I know he adores you
even though you're a concubine's daughter.

757
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,881
You may be a daughter to him,

758
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,549
but to me, you're just a slave.

759
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,721
Then please let him
keep misunderstanding it.

760
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,766
Until the wedding day,

761
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,269
please let my family believe
that I am to marry the young master.

762
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,146
And why must I do so?

763
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,774
Lord Hong is not the kind of father

764
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,026
who would marry his daughter off

765
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,403
to a widower in his seventies.

766
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,408
You must know his character
as well, my lord.

767
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,118
And

768
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,412
if Lord Hong were not where he is now

769
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,541
because of the literati purge,

770
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:11,711
you would not have asked such a favor

771
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,006
of a man who was once

772
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,551
the Minister of War.

773
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,431
Are you saying I dishonored your father?

774
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,561
Very well. Go on.

775
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,398
Let it be said that this marriage
was solely my own desire.

776
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:36,278
My desire to live in comfort
under the protection of a powerful family.

777
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,906
What a truly devoted daughter you are.

778
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,994
I could never compare to you, my lord.

779
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,625
My father will never rise
from his sickbed.

780
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,461
That means

781
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:57,507
you will never be able
to live a woman's life.

782
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:01,219
Does causing your father grief
concern you more than that?

783
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:07,309
I would spend the rest of my life
living only with Lord Hong and my mother.

784
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,729
I have no regrets,
even if I cannot live a woman's life.

785
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,191
If you have such resolve,
why not refuse it?

786
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,945
When Lord Hong's property was confiscated,

787
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,574
you took in our household, my lord,

788
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:26,870
and helped us keep our home at least.

789
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,582
I'm merely grateful that
I can repay your kindness in this way.

790
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,002
It's for her filial piety.

791
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,631
Such a bright child

792
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,217
was born to a concubine.

793
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,680
He must have felt deep regret.

794
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,236
I have nothing to lose in this deal.

795
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,572
One.

796
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,866
Both the house and Lord Hong are safe now.

797
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,493
One.

798
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,453
Mother can live a comfortable life now.

799
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,163
One.

800
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,332
I'm marrying into a powerful family.

801
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,084
One.

802
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,545
I have grown children
and even grandchildren now.

803
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,463
One.

804
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,674
And my husband will be…

805
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,344
Eun-jo…

806
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:29,057
I will take care of your mother,
so do not worry

807
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,726
and live as a woman

808
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,605
sharing a life of grace and love
with your husband.

809
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:44,948
There is no marriage in Joseon
that trades in love.

810
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,952
And it applies even less
to a slave like me.

811
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,552
They say one feels unsettled
on the day before the wedding.

812
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,054
Maybe that's true.

813
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,224
That means

814
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:14,352
you will never be able
to live a woman's life.

815
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,189
Do I regret it now?

816
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,074
I didn't realize
I walked all the way here.

817
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,194
What is he doing here?

818
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,113
On the day of the full moon,
come to Soha Village around 6:00.

819
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,032
That was today?

820
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,703
Has he been waiting all along?

821
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,709
How did I end up here?

822
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,391
How strange.

823
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,228
Of all days,

824
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,441
of all times,

825
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,985
and

826
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,530
of all people…

827
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,774
If I am no longer allowed
to live a woman's life…

828
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,655
If tonight is my last chance…

829
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,468
What took you so long?

830
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,511
Do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting--

831
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,381
That…

832
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,342
That would be my reward.

833
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,897
Your Highness.

834
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,149
Your Highness.

835
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,235
Why is your face red?

836
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,362
I just got…

837
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,448
robbed now.

838
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,117
What did they steal?

839
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,371
Well…

840
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,522
I must have lost my mind.

841
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,233
Why did I do that?

842
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,074
Where did she go?

843
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,914
Oh, dear. It's getting late.

844
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,749
It's the curfew hour!

845
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,251
Close the gates!

846
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,675
Please forgive me
for my madness earlier today,

847
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:00,054
and forgive me in advance
for my future nosiness.

848
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,694
Maybe I missed her.

849
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:50,938
You.

850
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,443
I will catch you no matter what.

851
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,750
Security is especially tight today.

852
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,378
Gil-dong was the one
with the Baekjeong's mask.

853
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,755
If the woman kissed first,

854
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,257
it must be love.

855
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,592
Well, I do have the looks for it.

856
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,510
We must find him.

857
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:05,513
Has anyone seen this woman?

858
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,682
Why would you go to such lengths?

859
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,309
It's disgusting to see
a lowly concubine's daughter

860
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,602
acting like his sister.

861
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,687
He saw a suspicious man.

862
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,897
Heading to Chief Secretary's storehouse?

863
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,733
There you are, Gil-dong.

864
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,778
