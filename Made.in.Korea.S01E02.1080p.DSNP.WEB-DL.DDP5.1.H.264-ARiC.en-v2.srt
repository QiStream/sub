1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>The collapse
of the Mapo Citizens' Apartment</i>

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,094
<i>already notorious for shoddy construction…</i>

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,722
Would you look at that?
The world has gone crazy.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,849
It's not long
before everything goes to hell.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,143
Well, I guess it had a good run.

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,980
One day, the whole world will come
crashing down like that apartment.

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,315
Will you stop with the doom
and gloom already?

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,610
What about our Huijeong?
Want her to die before she even blooms?

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,864
I'm just saying. The world is
not going to fold that easily.

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,240
The doenjang stew is good.

11
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,159
I'm scared the baby might hear you.

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,496
With its so-called dad
spouting that kind of talk,

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,582
you think it'd even want to be born?

14
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,001
Geez. I'm sorry, okay? Let's just eat.

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,132
Who's that?

16
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,136
Damn, who is it?

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,305
Mr. Kim, it…
It's Robert.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,895
Are you nuts?

19
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,355
I told you not to come to my house.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,442
Mr. Kim, we're going back
to the States next week.

21
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,070
For old times' sake,
let me have it just this once.

22
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,404
I'll pay you double.

23
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,782
Double?

24
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,409
Damn it.

25
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,204
Come on.

26
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,710
Have you lost it?
What were you thinking calling them here?

27
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,005
I didn't. They showed up on their own.

28
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,304
Hello?

29
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,602
BEOMCHEON-DONG, CAFÉ C'EST…

30
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,898
Got it. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

31
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,446
They said they'll pay double.

32
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,116
Let's just give it
and send them away. Go get it.

33
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,995
Hurry, go grab it.

34
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,609
What? Have you lost your mind?

35
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,404
What the hell are you doing?

36
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,808
Huh? Mr. Jang.

37
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,893
Be careful.

38
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,163
Evening, sir.

39
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,584
The victims were married.

40
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,422
Kim Taeyeong, 29 years old,
and his wife, Lee Suni, 26.

41
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,049
They had a three-year-old daughter, and…

42
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,137
the wife was pregnant.

43
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,223
Oh, and this.

44
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,654
The US Army already took them
into custody and got their confessions.

45
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,824
First,

46
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,952
let's get the kid out of here.

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,164
She doesn't really have
anywhere else to go.

48
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,667
Her uncle's on his way now.

49
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,963
Is it because of the rain?

50
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,424
The whole place reeks of blood.

51
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,237
BEOMCHEON-DONG,
CAFÉ C'EST LA VIE, 6 P.M., 1 KG

52
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,786
<i>This child's parents were drug dealers.</i>

53
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,209
<i>Middlemen who got meth from suppliers
and sold it on to end consumers.</i>

54
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,962
<i>The couple seemed as ordinary as anyone,</i>

55
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>but they were murdered
by US soldiers while dealing drugs.</i>

56
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,013
<i>Those US soldiers were addicted to meth.</i>

57
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,850
<i>They never had the money
to buy it in the first place.</i>

58
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,853
<i>With no money, they had to steal.</i>

59
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,356
<i>Once you're hooked on meth…</i>

60
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,108
- Move, please!
- <i>…nothing else matters.</i>

61
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,234
This way, sir.

62
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,821
<i>I bet that's what happened
when they killed this girl's parents.</i>

63
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:50,493
<i>They decided their own craving
mattered more than someone else's life.</i>

64
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,207
<i>This girl's name is Kim Huijeong.</i>

65
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,210
<i>Now that her parents are dead,</i>

66
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,880
<i>the bottle in her mouth
is all she has to survive on.</i>

67
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,759
<i>When she grows up,
will she remember this moment?</i>

68
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,513
<i>People say time heals all wounds.</i>

69
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,850
<i>That everything gets better with time.</i>

70
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,146
<i>But this girl will remember this
for the rest of her life.</i>

71
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,983
<i>Her own face as she sucked on the bottle,</i>

72
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,820
<i>her parents' faces as their throats
were cut over a drug deal,</i>

73
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,739
<i>and the stench of blood
that filled the room.</i>

74
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,119
<i>If there really is a God,</i>

75
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,955
<i>may he save this girl's soul</i>

76
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,625
<i>from the power of the dog.</i>

77
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,920
Good afternoon, sir.

78
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,004
What's that?

79
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,924
Well, I went home
to grab some files I'd forgotten.

80
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,676
- On your bike?
- Yes.

81
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,345
Did you guys eat yet?

82
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,429
Yes.

83
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,931
Sure did.

84
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,392
Can you order me
a jjajangmyeon? Make it extra-large.

85
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,728
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, Jang!

86
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,398
Listen.

87
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,276
You said you weren't
taking public security cases.

88
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,070
That's right.

89
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,656
Then focus on narcotics.

90
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,951
Why are you poking around
in a public security case?

91
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:41,664
It's connected to the victims
in my case, so I looked into it.

92
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,002
Being a KCIA informant doesn't mean
you can't be a junkie too, right?

93
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,086
Jang.

94
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,797
When I first met you at the Seoul Office,

95
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,342
I was a section chief, and you were
just a prosecutor with no title, right?

96
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,137
And when I was in Gwangju
as a departmental chief,

97
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,472
you still had no title.

98
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,435
And now, I've been sent here
to Busan as the deputy chief prosecutor.

99
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,730
But you? You're still without a title.

100
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,942
All your peers are section chiefs now,
some moving up to departmental chiefs.

101
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,238
How long will you keep drifting
around the country without a title?

102
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,076
Well, all I can do is give it my best.

103
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,121
That's exactly why
you never get promoted. You're too rigid.

104
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,998
No flexibility!

105
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,668
Learn to work the hierarchy.

106
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,254
What do you think an organization is, huh?

107
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,259
An organization is a place where you work.

108
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,179
I still have work to do,
so I'd better get to it now.

109
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,390
Jang. Don't mess with the KCIA, all right?

110
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,393
Cross them and we're
the only ones who bleed.

111
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,105
Okay. I'll keep that
in mind and do my best, sir.

112
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,359
We certainly can't have
bloodshed on the job.

113
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,902
You're impossible.

114
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,946
Open a window in here, will you?
It smells like…

115
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,575
And turn the lights on!
It's so dark in here.

116
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,369
- Yes, sir.
- What is this, a rat's nest?

117
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,912
Geez.

118
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,538
Well, I'm off!

119
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,750
Good day, sir!

120
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,336
Turn them off.

121
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
The lights.

122
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,050
Goodness.

123
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,680
It's nice and gloomy, isn't it?

124
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,522
- You order my jjajangmyeon yet?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,905
DIRECTOR GENERAL HWANG GUKPYEONG

126
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,159
<i>Director General Hwang Gukpyeong,
my direct superior.</i>

127
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,787
<i>In charge of the entire
Busan branch of the KCIA.</i>

128
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,871
It got on me.

129
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,998
<i>One word from him,
and the whole city moves.</i>

130
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,668
Anyway,

131
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,879
about Jo Manjae.

132
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,968
I hear he's been
dealing meth with the Yakuza.

133
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,052
Yes, I'm aware.

134
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,976
You're aware?

135
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,061
Yes, sir.

136
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,988
<i>That meth is what I loaded
onto the plane and sent off to Pyongyang.</i>

137
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>The Manjae Gang's meth.</i>

138
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,056
<i>The Manjae Gang,
Busan's biggest crime syndicate.</i>

139
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,059
KANG DAEIL,
THE MANJAE GANG UNDERBOSS

140
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,895
JO MANJAE,
THE MANJAE GANG BOSS

141
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,565
<i>Under Director Hwang's protection,
they grew fast.</i>

142
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,985
<i>They kick back 30%
of their monthly take to him,</i>

143
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,196
<i>straight into the KCIA's pocket.</i>

144
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,450
<i>The gang pulls every crime in the book</i>

145
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,744
<i>and rakes in a million dollars
from the underworld.</i>

146
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:10,080
<i>At this point, you could say
they practically run the Busan economy.</i>

147
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,845
EPISODE 2: THE POWER OF THE DOG

148
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,891
I was planning to take care of it myself.

149
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,186
Jang Geonyoung, a prosecutor
at the Busan District Prosecutors' Office,

150
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,439
is apparently gunning for Jo Manjae,
all fired up.

151
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,776
They say he's a Marine legend
who once took down armed guerrillas

152
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,738
with his bare hands and got
a Hwarang Order of Military Merit for it.

153
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:48,536
And he's the kind of loose cannon
who doesn't give a damn about higher-ups.

154
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,456
So how do you plan on
handling him, Mr. Baek?

155
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,251
Don't worry, sir.

156
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,294
I'll take care of him myself.

157
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,901
Why don't you guys go out for a smoke?

158
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,905
Sit.

159
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,953
- Everything good while I was away?
- Yes, sir. All good.

160
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,999
Listen, look into
Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung

161
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,543
at the Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

162
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,880
His background, family,
relatives, friends, personality…

163
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,133
Well, whatever it is,
don't miss a single detail.

164
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,469
Dig up every last thing
connected to him and bring it to me.

165
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,971
Yes, sir.

166
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,025
Ah. Nice to meet you. John Evans.

167
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,192
Just call me John.

168
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,528
Okay, John.

169
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,324
What are those bastards doing here?

170
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,701
Exercise. One hour per day.

171
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,039
The murderers have rights too? Hmm?

172
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,415
Don't they in Korea?

173
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,005
Let's get done with this quickly.

174
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,592
We've already provided enough information
with the police regarding their cases.

175
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,011
That's different, man.

176
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,221
Look.

177
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,894
In the corner. Here.

178
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,729
Something's written.

179
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,607
Remember the man you killed?

180
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,861
He wrote it down when he was in the phone…

181
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,196
No. On the phone.

182
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,618
Any phone call when you were in the house?

183
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,957
Uh… Mr. Kim picked up the phone
and wrote something down on the paper.

184
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,458
Okay.

185
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,503
But…

186
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,672
if you look at it,

187
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,674
there's no date.

188
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,678
Only the time and place.

189
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,097
It's a deal. A drug deal.

190
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,683
Is there anything you heard about it?

191
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,393
These guys cannot understand Korean.

192
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,312
Even if they heard something,
they wouldn't know what it meant.

193
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,151
Yeah, I know.
But I wanted to ask, just in case.

194
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,530
They should know a few words in Korean,
now that they're in Korea.

195
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,824
- So damn disrespectful.
- What?

196
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,326
Okay.

197
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,747
Now, you listen carefully. Hmm?

198
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,124
To what I say.

199
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,921
"If you cooperate with me,

200
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,049
I may be able to cut down your sentence.

201
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,220
Then you can be sent back
to your country in a few years,

202
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:58,267
or I could even let you serve
your sentence in the States."

203
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,935
Understand?

204
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,437
It's a deal!

205
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,439
It's a deal!

206
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,149
"See you tomorrow."

207
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,240
Mr. Kim said, "See you tomorrow."

208
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,825
You speak Korean?

209
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,326
My girlfriend's Korean.

210
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,040
Tomorrow?

211
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,624
You sure?

212
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,170
- Tomorrow.
- I'm sure.

213
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,255
Good job.

214
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,968
Oh, right.

215
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,262
By the way…

216
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,183
The woman you killed, Lee Suni.

217
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,563
She was pregnant.

218
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,283
We've received intel

219
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,452
that the meth dealers murdered last night,

220
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,413
Kim Taeyeong and his wife, Lee Suni,

221
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:07,086
had a deal lined up
with their supplier today at 6:00 p.m.

222
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,214
at the Café C'est La Vie
in Beomcheon-dong.

223
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:15,469
Assuming the supplier doesn't know
they're dead yet, he's expected to show.

224
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,722
Two of our investigators
will pose as the couple on site

225
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,350
and the moment he shows up,
we move in for the arrest.

226
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,938
Hello, I'm here.

227
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,107
Ah, Ms. Oh!

228
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,360
Sir, this is Ms. Oh.
She'll be playing the wife.

229
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,405
Hello, sir.

230
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,867
I'm Oh Yejin.
I've just been assigned to the team.

231
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,411
I'll be playing the wife, Lee Suni,
in today's operation.

232
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,622
Right. Welcome aboard, Investigator Oh.

233
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,751
So… What about the husband?

234
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,836
Right.

235
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,756
That's me.

236
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,720
We'll need to find you
a different husband.

237
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,347
I think that's a good idea, sir.

238
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,141
Wait, why? What's wrong?

239
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,853
Attention, everyone!

240
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,148
All right,

241
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,733
choose your husband from among them.

242
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,319
You think they're any better?

243
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,414
What?

244
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,677
MUSIC CAFÉ C'EST LA VIE
COFFEE & TEA

245
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,012
Welcome.

246
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,693
C'est La Vie.

247
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,363
Mr. Kim Taeyeong?

248
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,622
Hello?

249
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,167
<i>Take Bus 57 and get off
at Myeonhak-ri Station.</i>

250
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,092
Wait, too fast. Hey, slow down.

251
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,510
Slow down. Come on.

252
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,558
They're not going to lose us, right?

253
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,147
Just act natural.

254
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,565
Don't be so nervous.

255
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,776
Right.

256
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,906
Okay then.

257
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,909
Mind if I ask you something?

258
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,077
Sure, what is it?

259
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,287
Well…

260
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,460
Have you always been
this good-looking, Mr. Jang?

261
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,049
Are you…

262
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,971
hitting on me just to loosen up?

263
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,182
Come on, of course not.

264
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,726
Someone like me hitting on you? No way.

265
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,354
You think I'd make a fool of myself,

266
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,274
hitting on someone who's not interested?

267
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,151
I must be losing my mind.

268
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,112
My nerves have me speaking nonsense.

269
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,408
But I really did want to ask you that.

270
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,911
Just forget it. I'm sorry.

271
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,795
I hear you studied law at PNU
and took the bar exam.

272
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,881
Yes, that's right.

273
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,591
Will you try again this year?

274
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,971
Well, that's…

275
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,931
Are you giving up?

276
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,268
Even if I pass, what's the point?

277
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,312
They'd never appoint
a woman as a prosecutor.

278
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,481
There isn't a single female prosecutor
in this country yet.

279
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,026
Then why do you want to be one?

280
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,238
What about you, Mr. Jang?

281
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,740
Why did you become a prosecutor?

282
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,970
MYEONHAK-RI

283
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,976
Mr. Jang got off the bus.

284
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,062
All right, just keep driving for now.

285
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,730
Yes, sir.

286
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,232
Do they look like husband and wife?

287
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,152
Yeah, they look good together. Sure.

288
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,198
Do you see anything?

289
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,367
No, nothing. It's too dark.

290
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:52,037
Oh, right. You can't see a thing
without your glasses, can you?

291
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,830
You are my eyes right now.

292
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,707
- Look carefully.
- Okay.

293
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,380
Look. That car! Here he comes!

294
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,008
Over there. That's him.

295
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,982
Put your hands
in your pockets and relax.

296
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,859
- You're as stiff as a board.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,395
<i>He looks familiar. Who is he?</i>

298
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,898
Let's see the stuff first!

299
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,074
Let's see the cash first.

300
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,895
Well, this stuff is nice.

301
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,229
Yeah, good stuff.

00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,970
You son of a bitch! Hey!

321
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,888
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

322
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,973
You bastard!

323
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,352
Hey! You bastard!

324
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,939
- Hey! Stop, you bastard!
- Stop right there!

325
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,569
Damn! That hurts.

326
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,612
Hey! Oh, stay right there!

327
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,114
Hey!

328
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,492
You're so dead!

329
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,952
Get back here!

330
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,417
You son of a bitch!

331
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,919
Hey!

332
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,422
Stop right there!

333
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,090
Hey!

334
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,301
Where the hell do you think you're going?

335
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,177
Hey! You little shit!

336
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,388
God, that son of a bitch. Fucking bastard.

337
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,851
Investigator Oh!

338
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,062
Investigator Oh! Stop right there!

339
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:50,108
Shit, she's so damn fast. Fuck!

340
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,526
For Christ's sake!

341
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,538
Where did he go?

342
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,962
Goddamn it!

343
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,214
I'm going to kill that bastard!

344
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,138
Investigator Oh!

345
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,433
Investigator Oh!

346
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,562
That girl's so damn relentless.
Fucking hell.

347
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,647
Investigator Oh.

348
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,398
Investigator Oh…

349
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,527
Where is he?

350
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,363
Where the hell did he go?

351
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,199
Damn, that bastard.

352
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,044
Shit…

353
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,714
Hey.

354
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,259
Paying respects to your ancestors?

355
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,054
What are you doing over there
with your head on the ground?

356
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,972
For fuck's sake.

357
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,600
Hey, get out here. Come sit down.

358
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,352
Fucking hell.

359
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,813
Let's talk for a second, all right?

360
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,315
Man, I'm fucking exhausted.

361
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,696
Goddamn it.

362
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,657
You can run, huh?

363
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,243
Where's Oh, my investigator?

364
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,872
Your investigator?
How the fuck would I know!

365
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,999
This asshole's got
another knife. You little…

366
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,504
Wait! Hold up. Stop.

367
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,297
What?

368
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,721
Shit.

369
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,764
Come here! Get back here, you bastard!

370
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,182
Get back here! You little…

371
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,566
Give it a rest, jackass.

372
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,403
How many damn knives do you have? Hey!

373
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,989
Hey, you little… Son of a…

374
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,700
You little shit.

375
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,910
Get the hell off, asshole.

376
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,620
Damn it.

377
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,584
You son of a bitch.

378
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,544
Hey, you son of a bitch!

379
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,923
You asshole!

380
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,468
Where do you think you're going?

381
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,178
You bastard.

382
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,851
Investigator Oh.

383
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,272
- Did you use to work out?
- My father's a tae kwon do master.

384
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,442
- Stay still, you asshole!
- You're tough.

385
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,902
I'll smash your face in.

386
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,447
Not at all. I'm soft as can be.

387
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,868
Don't ever do anything
I didn't tell you to again.

388
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,078
Yes, sir. Understood.

389
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,705
Get up.

390
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,916
I said, get up!

391
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,421
- They're not up there.
- No? Not there either?

392
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,881
I don't think they're here.

393
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,257
Go check up there. This way.

394
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,092
- Up there?
- Yeah, go take a look.

395
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,470
- Mr. Jang! Mr. Jang!
- Damn.

396
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,389
Mr. Jang!

397
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,934
You know,

398
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,728
if you get locked up this time,

399
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,815
it's 10 years minimum.

400
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,109
Fuck.

401
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,572
Ten years just for pushing some meth?
I don't think so.

402
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,366
It's not like I killed anyone.

403
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,328
I'll probably be out in a couple.

404
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,375
Bullshit.

405
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,962
The Manjae Gang's number two,
out selling drugs himself?

406
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,173
Why would you do that, huh?

407
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,178
What are they saying?

408
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,598
Hey.

409
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,645
You've been sneaking out drugs
behind Jo Manjae's back, haven't you?

410
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,230
If he finds out…

411
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,651
you think he'll let you get away with it?

412
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,113
His number two stealing his stash?

413
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,659
Fucking hell.

414
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,829
So what do you want?

415
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,747
Listen carefully.

416
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,832
The thing is,

417
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,919
it's Jo Manjae that I really want.

418
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,631
Which means you can save yourself

419
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,009
if you just do what I say.

420
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,511
You want me to be a goddamn rat?

421
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,598
If I get caught, I'm the only one fucked.

422
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,849
So why should I?

423
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,643
Damn it, you thick-headed idiot.

424
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,811
Hey.

425
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,565
You dumbass.
Does your brain even work? Hmm?

426
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,569
Do you not get
who's holding your leash right now?

427
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,238
I don't want the small fry
with a kilo or two.

428
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,491
I want 10 kilos or more,
the kind of deal Manjae handles himself.

429
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,785
The choice is yours.

430
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,371
Be a goddamn rat,

431
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,374
or die at Jo Manjae's hands.

432
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,089
Investigator Oh.

433
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,430
The key.

434
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,308
- What key?
- To the handcuffs.

435
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,518
Why?

436
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,577
What…

437
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,331
Get out of here. Go.

438
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,750
What? Oh!

439
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,337
Mr. Jang! What the hell are you doing?

440
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,882
- I let him go.
- Why?

441
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,385
This stays between you and me.

442
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,972
It's our little secret.

443
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,642
His mother is dead.

444
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,478
He's got a father and a younger sister.

445
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,689
Yes, the father's name is Jang Myeongho.

446
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,357
He's in a psychiatric hospital.

447
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,442
Psychiatric hospital?

448
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,861
He's been there a long time,
about 20 years.

449
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,863
What for?

450
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,948
I'm looking into it.

451
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,700
What about his sister?

452
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,119
Jang Hyeeun, 25 years old.

453
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,206
She works at a dye factory in Gyeonggi-do.
There's nothing unusual about her.

454
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,749
Check the people around him too.

455
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,168
Report back if you find anything useful.

456
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,294
Yes, sir.

457
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:30,049
And about Ikeda Yuji,
the one you mentioned last time.

458
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,551
Did you look into her?

459
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,011
Her real name is Choi Yuji.

460
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,721
She's a <i>Zainichi</i>.

461
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,598
A <i>Zainichi</i>?

462
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,643
Yes, she lost both her parents
when she was 13.

463
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,062
Then Chairman Ikeda adopted her.

464
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,024
He seems to put a lot of trust in her.

465
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,109
She's got real pull in the organization,

466
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,153
with plenty of people gunning for her.

467
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,446
Choi Yuji.

468
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,781
I'll see you again.

469
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,587
Look at that idiot.

470
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,137
But why are you looking into Choi Yuji?

471
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,809
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,690
Choi Yuji…

473
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,070
While you were out earlier,
Mr. Baek Kihyun called.

474
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,154
What did he say?

475
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,157
He's coming today
for your mother's memorial.

476
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,451
He said he couldn't make it.

477
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,786
He's in the army, right?

478
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,832
Top of his class at the Military Academy.

479
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,876
Top of his class…

480
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,670
It's just a matter of time
before he pins on a star, right?

481
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,964
A star? Sure, he'll get one.

482
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,093
The question is, how many.

483
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,478
Hey, Baek Kihyun.

484
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,786
Let's eat.

485
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,998
Thank you for the meal.

486
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:15,006
Kihyun was only in first
or second grade when Mom passed.

487
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,301
Time really flies. Doesn't it, Kitae?

488
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,139
How's life in the army? Doing all right?

489
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,558
I'm doing fine.

490
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,061
Is something up?

491
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,191
I wish it were.

492
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,489
Staring at barbed wire
on the front line is boring, no?

493
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,200
SECURITY COMMAND
AHN SEUNGHYEOK

494
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,869
He'll let you know once a spot opens up
at Security Command.

495
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,789
You always wanted to go there
after graduating the academy.

496
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,709
I can take care of myself.

497
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,504
Just let me help you.
What are big brothers for?

498
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,006
Right, Soyeong?

499
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,591
You're right.

500
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,179
But you know, Kihyun's all grown up now.

501
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,473
His opinion matters too.

502
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,191
Just take it.

503
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,818
I'm sure plenty of others got his card.

504
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,488
I told you.

505
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,741
In the end, guys with money
and connections run the world.

506
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:28,037
That's true. Life is brutal
without parents or connections.

507
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,289
But things get easier
if you have money and power.

508
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,415
Funny how that works.

509
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,504
Kitae.

510
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,926
I can take care of myself.

511
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,431
Fine.

512
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,308
Let me know if you change your mind.

513
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,990
So, your plan is to use Kang Daeil
as a mole to get Jo Manjae?

514
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:05,992
Yes.

515
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,415
But what if Kang Daeil doesn't
play along and just disappears on you?

516
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,625
What are you going to do then?

517
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,755
He'll have no choice but to do as I say
if he wants to stay alive.

518
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,590
How can you be so sure?

519
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,551
Because Kang Daeil, that punk,

520
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,012
has been skimming drugs
behind his boss's back.

521
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,224
It means being a number two
isn't enough for him.

522
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,018
What are you…

523
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,686
I promised him

524
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,357
I'd make him number one in the gang.

525
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,943
Once I take down Jo Manjae,

526
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,946
Kang Daeil becomes the boss of the gang.

527
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,201
So then,

528
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:54,749
you're going to take down Jo Manjae,
but really just let Kang Daeil walk free?

529
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,630
First, I take down Jo Manjae.

530
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,508
Then, I'll put Kang Daeil behind bars too.

531
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,351
Mr. Jang.

532
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,977
Yeah.

533
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,812
You know Alain Delon, right?

534
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,439
Alain Delon? What about him?

535
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,649
You know, in those movies,

536
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:26,238
he goes around killing people brutally
with that handsome face.

537
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,618
And then he smokes,
just like you are right now.

538
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,496
Yeah. That's it.

539
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:42,838
Every time I watch him,
I get butterflies for some reason.

540
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,425
People must tell you all the time
you look like him, right?

541
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,141
Enough with the nonsense.

542
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,478
Take a look at this photo.

543
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,443
That guy next to Jo Manjae.

544
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,198
Looks like Jo Manjae's bowing
and scraping to him.

545
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,117
Who's the guy, his backer?

546
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,245
We'll know who he is
once we've got Jo Manjae.

547
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,459
Wow, there's another Alain Delon here.

548
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,424
Just how many Alain Delons
do you see exactly?

549
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,553
Me? Only one, of course.

550
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,432
Cheers.

551
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,250
9TH, 8 P.M.
ROOM 611, BUSAN HOTEL

552
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,765
Ms. Oh, the phone.

553
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,146
- Hello?
<i>- Is this the Chinese restaurant?</i>

554
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,273
No, it's not.

555
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,066
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

556
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,818
What the hell?

557
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,571
Is there something wrong with our number?

558
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,655
What's up?

559
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,574
Well, we keep getting wrong numbers.

560
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,368
Someone else called earlier asking
if this was a bathhouse.

561
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,495
It's so weird.

562
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,913
Let's go eat.

563
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,539
Yes, sir.

564
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,919
What should we have today?

565
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,504
Man, I'm starving.

566
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,923
Pork and rice soup? What do you think?

567
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,174
But we had it yesterday.

568
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,093
- You're right.
- How about a set meal?

569
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,803
Sounds good to me.

570
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,140
Wait for me!

571
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,059
How about jjajangmyeon?

572
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,944
No answer.

573
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,376
PROSECUTION SERVICE

580
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,315
Hey, Jang.

581
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,067
Join me for lunch.

582
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,195
I'm meeting with the chief editor
of <i>Joguk Ilbo</i>.

583
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,490
- You haven't eaten yet, have you?
- Oh, dear. I just ate, actually.

584
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,159
Yeah? Then drop by my office later.

585
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,495
- I've got something to tell you.
- Yes, sir.

586
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,415
Right. I'll be tied up
questioning suspects this afternoon.

587
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,624
I'll come by tomorrow morning.

588
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,042
- All right.
- Yeah.

589
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,045
Hey, Jang! You'd better show up!

590
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
Let's clear out.

591
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:17,733
Looks like everyone thoughtlessly
ran off to lunch once again,

592
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,694
with papers lying around
and the door unlocked.

593
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,030
And you are?

594
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,580
I'm Baek Kitae, KCIA Busan branch.

595
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,707
<i>This guy's name</i>

596
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,417
<i>is Baek Kitae.</i>

597
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,211
That guy next to Jo Manjae.

598
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,923
<i>He's with the KCIA?</i>

599
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,176
Jang Geonyoung,
Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

600
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,516
So, what brings the KCIA all the way here?

601
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,518
There must be a reason

602
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,522
you're standing in the middle of
someone else's office while they're out.

603
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,525
You know Jo Manjae, right?

604
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,985
The Manjae Gang's number one.

605
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,111
Right, the Manjae Gang.

606
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,113
I came here

607
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,284
to ask you to drop Jo Manjae. Lay off him.

608
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,960
You're telling me
to shut down my investigation?

609
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,878
The KCIA

610
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,756
giving orders to a prosecutor?

611
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,636
I didn't mean it like that.

612
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,889
Then what?

613
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,183
At least give me a proper explanation.

614
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:41,233
Did you know Jo Manjae's
married to a <i>Zainichi</i>?

615
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,359
Yes.

616
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,823
According to our recent intel,

617
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,451
his wife has been deeply involved
with North Korea.

618
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,419
So Jo Manjae is tangled up
with commies now, huh?

619
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:04,047
We got word that his gang's been
pushing meth up North through Japan.

620
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,842
We've been running an operation
on this for over a year now.

621
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,596
I went undercover
to make contact with Jo Manjae myself.

622
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,974
So you're saying,
the KCIA's already working him,

623
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,226
and I'm supposed to back off?

624
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,186
We're all civil servants here.

625
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,147
We should help one another, shouldn't we?

626
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,524
It's all for the country after all.

627
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,284
Okay!

628
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,744
Got it.

629
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,371
I'll leave Jo Manjae to you then.

630
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,832
That goddamn commie.

631
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,418
Thank you for understanding.

632
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,170
Gosh, don't mention it.

633
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,964
You moved to Busan
about two months ago, right?

634
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,215
Yeah, that's right.

635
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,969
You're from Seoul, so I bet
it hasn't been easy settling in here.

636
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,889
We should grab some raw fish sometime.

637
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,766
I'll take you someplace nice.

638
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,060
Ah, actually…

639
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,897
I'm not really into raw fish.

640
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,316
When we get the chance,

641
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,110
let's have some soju instead,
with pork and rice soup.

642
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,195
That sounds good too.

643
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,530
All right, then. I'll give you a call.

644
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,217
Jo Manjae is…

645
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,680
tied up with commies, huh?

646
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,693
Yeah, right.

647
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,654
Who the hell does he think he's fooling?

648
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,971
- Let's go eat.
- Yes, sir.

649
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,818
Mr. Jang isn't here yet.

650
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,324
- Turn the lights off.
- Damn, you scared me.

651
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,618
It's broad daylight.

652
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,911
I didn't see you there.

653
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,873
Save if you want a better life.

654
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:47,294
<i>Well, I picked up some lunch for you.</i>

655
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,920
<i>Have you eaten yet?</i>

656
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,589
<i>No.</i>

657
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,632
<i>Where's Mr. Kim and…</i>

658
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,967
Where is everyone?

659
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,719
He said he was going to court.

660
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,929
The other investigators
are out at the scene.

661
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,818
<i>Were you hungry?</i>

662
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,071
<i>Slow down, or you'll get indigestion.</i>

663
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,990
<i>Here. Take a look.</i>

664
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,745
What's this?

665
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,748
9TH, 8 P.M.
ROOM 611, BUSAN HOTEL

666
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,792
He says the Yakuza's coming to Busan.

667
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,419
The Yakuza?

668
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,504
Yes.

669
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,300
<i>He's meeting Jo Manjae at Busan Hotel.</i>

670
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,928
<i>Uh… It's about the meth, right?</i>

671
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,305
That's what it looks like.

672
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,932
Damn.

673
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,810
This time…

674
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,064
we have to get Jo Manjae.

675
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,359
<i>Hang on.</i>

676
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,069
<i>The 9th?</i>

677
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,446
<i>That's the day after tomorrow, isn't it?</i>

678
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,532
<i>That's right.
The day after tomorrow.</i>

679
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,285
<i>Oh, right. The KCIA was here earlier.</i>

680
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,499
- The KCIA? W-Why?
- Yeah.

681
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,084
What business…

682
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,920
could they possibly have

683
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,756
<i>here at the Busan District
Prosecutors' Office?</i>

684
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,133
<i>What could've brought the KCIA here?</i>

685
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,136
<i>Exactly.
What could've brought them here?</i>

686
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,303
Look at this guy.

687
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,033
<i>Boss, he's here.</i>

688
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,701
<i>Yeah? All right.</i>

689
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,708
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Jo Manjae.

690
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,131
<i>He says hello.</i>

691
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,759
<i>Have a seat.</i>

692
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:51,186
So, is this your first time in Busan?

693
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,737
<i>He used to live here as a kid.</i>

694
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,616
<i>So he's a </i>Zainichi<i>?</i>

695
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,502
He's Japanese, and he was here in 1944.

696
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,922
That's before liberation.

697
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:25,845
My grandfather was killed by a Jap bullet
at the Battle of Cheongsan-ri, you know.

698
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,599
<i>Well…</i>

699
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,940
Well, never mind.

700
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,861
History's history,
and business is business, eh?

701
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,991
<i>Go get the stuff.</i>

702
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,827
<i>Uh… We'll bring it to you now.</i>

703
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,711
Looks good.

704
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,213
But…

705
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,925
you think you can move
10 kilos every month?

706
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,512
He's asking if we can do
10 kilos every month.

707
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,681
<i>Let's see the cash first.</i>

708
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,687
<i>Hey.</i>

709
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,946
<i>Tell him we can do 20 kilos.</i>

710
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,952
<i>That's impressive.</i>

711
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,413
"Sugoi"?

712
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,999
<i>"</i>Sugoi<i>" means "impressive."</i>

713
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,462
<i>Cheers.</i>

714
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,384
<i>Sounds like they're hitting it off, huh?</i>

715
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,137
<i>All right.</i>

716
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,723
<i>I'd say we're good to go.</i>

717
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,442
We got it on tape, right?

718
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,113
All right.

719
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,908
<i>Everyone, grab your gear. Let's go.</i>

720
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,413
Move in.

721
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,672
Turn the light on. The light.

722
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,509
I think it's a blackout. What do we do?

723
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,351
- Hey, go see what's going on.
- Yes, sir.

724
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,108
What the hell?

725
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,278
Stop resisting, you bastards!

726
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,864
- On your knees, punk!
- On your knees!

727
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,451
Open the door!

728
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,079
Hey, you bastard!

729
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,544
Open the fucking door!

730
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,682
All clear, sir.

731
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:32,657
Open the door! Hey, open the door!

732
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,631
Get the tear gas!

733
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,843
Head on the ground, asshole!

734
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,428
Hey!

735
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,534
Hey, the tear gas!

736
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,704
Shit, it's hot!

737
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,080
It's hot!

738
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,668
Move!

739
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,463
Move!

740
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,089
Move!

741
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,839
Do you not realize how serious this is?

742
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,759
The Japanese Metropolitan
Police Department

743
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,095
put those Yakuza bastards
on the wanted list.

744
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,515
They even sent over a formal request
for cooperation, Mr. Jo.

745
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:24,185
Sir, I'm really sorry
we didn't clear it with you first.

746
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,689
But still, after everything
we've paid up until now,

747
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,816
isn't this the time
you step in and cover us?

748
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,150
Who the hell is this guy?

749
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,280
Sir, please forgive him.

750
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,283
This guy doesn't…
He doesn't know any better.

751
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,784
It won't happen again.

752
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,579
We just got a little greedy and messed up.

753
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:47,292
If you help us out just this once,
we'll make sure to pay you back for it!

754
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,587
Wow. This one's got
more guts than him, right?

755
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,838
Hey, you're better.

756
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,424
Yeah, you're right.

757
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,302
He's got guts.
If you'd forgive us just this once…

758
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,478
Shut it.

759
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,158
Sir, it's probably best to leave him.

760
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,662
We'll need someone to pull the gang
back together as their new leader.

761
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,169
The election's right around the corner.

762
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,180
You think you can do well?

763
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,725
Yes, sir.

764
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,268
Yeah?

765
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,366
<i>On your knees!</i>

766
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,160
<i>- Stay still!
- Stop resisting!</i>

767
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,954
<i>On your knees!</i>

768
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,749
<i>- Stay still!
- Stop resisting!</i>

769
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,085
<i>On your knees!</i>

770
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,712
<i>- Stay still!
- Stop resisting!</i>

771
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,136
Who the hell screwed us over
and snatched Jo Manjae?

772
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,515
- Hello. So…
- Morning, sir.

773
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:29,352
Did you guys clean the office yet?

774
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,397
- Clean?
- No, we didn't…

775
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,524
How many times
have I told you to clean up?

776
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,109
Just look at this place!

777
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,527
I'm sorry, sir.

778
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,030
Ms. Oh, go and…
Go get the broom and the dustpan.

779
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,032
Yes, sir.
I'll bring the dustpan and sweep up.

780
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,536
And these useless boxes.
Get them all out to the storage room!

781
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,912
Okay, I'll clear them out.

782
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,123
And what the hell
is this bag doing here, huh?

783
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,208
Why would you leave
a bag lying around here?

784
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,876
- I'm sorry.
- I'll put it away.

785
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,806
Lay low for a while.

786
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,560
You don't have to give me all this.

787
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,105
I won't breathe a word to Director Hwang.

788
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,523
Don't worry, sir.

789
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,360
If I was worried
about you running your mouth,

790
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,987
I would've let you die back there.

791
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,072
Then why did you…

792
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,157
I told you.

793
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,660
You're Jo Manjae's replacement now.

794
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,829
The whole gang's already in pieces,

795
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,999
so why would you even need a replacement?

796
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,585
The business.

797
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,212
You've got to keep it going, don't you?

798
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:42,216
All right, open up the cabinet
and toss out all those old files!

799
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,301
Yes, sir. I will.

800
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,511
How many times
have I told you to clean that out?

801
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,096
I'm sorry.

802
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,605
And this box!

803
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,815
- That's…
- I told you a hundred times

804
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,067
- to throw it out already! Geez!
- That… I'm sorry!

805
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,612
Mr. Jang, please
just leave it. We'll take care of it.

806
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,489
Just leave it. We'll do it.

807
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,411
Me?

808
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:14,999
You.

809
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,001
Me.

810
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,004
Us.

811
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,676
That meth business of yours.

812
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,931
I've had my eye on it for a long time.

813
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,600
Mr. Baek, I heard

814
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,395
you'll be going to Japan soon.

815
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,855
Would it be all right

816
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,483
if I asked you a small favor on your way?

817
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,987
<i>That's why
I did you guys the favor.</i>

818
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:50,034
I'll figure out a way to reopen
the connection with the Japanese.

819
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,911
In the meantime,

820
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,872
you take that money,
pull the guys back together,

821
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,625
and get the lab running again.

822
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:00,253
You want to sell the drugs yourself?

823
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,172
But…

824
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,800
A government man dealing drugs…

825
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:08,970
What?

826
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,014
Is that a problem?

827
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,016
No, sir.

828
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,518
Not at all.

829
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,568
<i>I thought
they were just petty thieves,</i>

830
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,280
<i>but turns out those bastards
are a lot more audacious than I expected.</i>

831
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,700
I'm Baek Kitae, KCIA Busan branch.

832
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,035
<i>Mr. Baek Kitae.</i>

833
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,204
<i>Looks like we'll be seeing
a lot of each other from now on.</i>

834
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,009
All right, that's enough cleaning!

835
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,343
Let's get to work!

836
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,708
