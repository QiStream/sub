1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,886
<i>It is time for the flag-lowering ceremony.</i>

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,390
<i>Please face the flag with respect.</i>

3
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,100
<i>I bet you're wondering,</i>

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,228
<i>"What is this, some kind of prank?"</i>

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>This is what they called
the flag-lowering ceremony.</i>

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,150
<i>Our dear Mr. President's own invention.</i>

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,444
<i>And that wasn't all.</i>

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,364
<i>After midnight, you couldn't even
be out on the streets.</i>

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,200
<i>It was to crack down on decadent trends</i>

10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,786
<i>that threatened public morals
and order or whatever.</i>

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,830
SEX INDUSTRY

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,125
<i>Men were banned
from growing sideburns over their ears,</i>

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:47,255
<i>and women in miniskirts were punished
for indecent exposure.</i>

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,467
<i>Curfews.</i>

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,718
<i>No assemblies.</i>

16
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,011
<i>No protests.</i>

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,972
<i>No long hair and no miniskirts, either.</i>

18
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,348
TO RESTORE SOCIAL DISCIPLINE

19
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,683
IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION

20
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,687
<i>People were monitored, raided,
beaten, and killed.</i>

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,232
KIM DAEJUNG RETURNED HOME

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,152
<i>If they could go
after heavyweight opposition politicians,</i>

23
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,571
<i>imagine what they did to ordinary people.</i>

24
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,699
<i>We were basically treated
like cattle, like pigs.</i>

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,828
<i>But the very ones leading the crackdowns?</i>

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,497
<i>They lived above every ban.</i>

27
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>That's right.</i>

28
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,044
<i>I'm talking about the country's
very first intelligence agency, the KCIA.</i>

29
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,128
GLOBAL SPY RING EXPOSED

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>With immense power that
even eclipsed the Constitution,</i>

31
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,345
<i>the KCIA propped up
our dear Mr. President's long reign.</i>

32
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>Just the name of it was enough
to strike fear.</i>

33
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,644
REVOLUTIONARY UNIFICATION
PARTY SPY CASE

34
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:47,357
<i>So many innocent people were dragged off,
and lost their lives.</i>

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,026
<i>Honestly though,</i>

36
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,571
<i>I never thought I'd be one of them.</i>

37
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,452
<i>This was the age of prohibition,
and my name says it all.</i>

38
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,705
<i>I'm Geumji, as in prohibition. Bae Geumji.</i>

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,795
<i>Madam, bar girl, escort, hostess.</i>

40
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,214
<i>Call me whatever you want.</i>

41
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>What matters is that I was</i>

42
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,804
<i>damn good at what I did.</i>

43
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,099
<i>But still,</i>

44
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,810
<i>it's not a crime worth dying for, right?</i>

45
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,957
GIMPO AIRPORT, KOREA

46
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,714
<i>Passengers for boarding,
please proceed to Gate Three</i>

47
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,634
<i>of the International Terminal
after completing immigration.</i>

48
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,183
Seriously?

49
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,809
No one's here?

50
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,645
Wow.

51
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,981
This is unbelievable.

52
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,566
Let's go.

53
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,408
EPISODE 3:
THE AGE OF PROHIBITION

54
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,800
All right, all right.

55
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,907
When we get there,
it won't just be Mr. Cheon waiting.

56
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,242
Bae Geumji will be there too.

57
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,369
Yes, sir. Understood.

58
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,539
They were nice enough
to send her off to the States.

59
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,793
She should've stayed put
and raised her kid quietly.

60
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,586
What good did she think
would come of this?

61
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,433
I hear she's a woman with no fear.

62
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,520
Yeah, I'll give her that.

63
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,313
Using her own damn kid like that.

64
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,482
Do you know, sir?

65
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,984
Who the father is.

66
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,569
There are a lot of rumors.

67
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,739
Hey.

68
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,825
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,121
Just keep your eyes on the road.

70
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,706
Unless you've got a death wish.

71
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,713
Have you met Mr. Cheon before?

72
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,299
No, this is my first time in person.

73
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,472
Born into the elite and

74
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,683
top of his class at the Military Academy.

75
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,145
He caught the President's eye
during the revolution,

76
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,232
and now, he throws around
more weight than ever.

77
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
No.

78
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,035
<i>Cheon Seokjung…</i>

79
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,870
<i>…Chief of the Presidential
Security Service.</i>

80
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,873
<i>Top of his class at the Military Academy,
adored by the President.</i>

81
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,877
<i>The President's power was
practically Cheon Seokjung's to wield,</i>

82
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,839
<i>and the KCIA was his loyal private army.</i>

83
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,883
I mean, look.

84
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,843
I can't live in hiding forever anyway.

85
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,346
It's not like I'm not a criminal.

86
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,932
I've got to sort things out somehow,

87
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,894
and raise my boy Seongguk
to not come up short next to anyone.

88
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,231
You really think
his father's going to sit back and watch?

89
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,900
What kind of father can't stand to see

90
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,902
his own son succeed?

91
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,989
You know better than anyone
he's not a man to be trifled with.

92
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,034
And I'm not a woman
to be trifled with either.

93
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,619
Come on.

94
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,789
It's not like I'm asking to be his wife.

95
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,168
Hello, Mr. Cheon.

96
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,463
How have you been, sir?

97
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,048
It's been a while, Mr. Hwang.

98
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,676
Why have you been so busy?

99
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,970
Oh, no. Not at all.

100
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:19,058
Just give me a call,
and I'll come running anytime, sir.

101
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,355
Ah… You wear a toupee, huh?

102
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,661
- Let's take a walk.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,257
<i>That's when Baek Kitae
saw with his own eyes…</i>

104
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,844
<i>…what real, living power looked like.</i>

105
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,889
Ah, I got it.

106
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,020
<i>And then he decided</i>

107
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,230
<i>to live a life like that man's,</i>

108
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,483
<i>with wealth and power great enough</i>

109
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,111
<i>to bring the whole world to its knees.</i>

110
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,946
Hello, darling.

111
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,953
I'm going to the restroom.

112
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,164
Care to join me?

113
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,252
<i>And that's how we met.</i>

114
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,797
<i>In the most romantic setting,
as you can see,</i>

115
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,967
<i>in the company of those
government idiots.</i>

116
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,541
There's no need
to worry about wiretaps here, sir.

117
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,001
It's so loud in here.

118
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,962
Loud and perfect
for a secret investigation HQ.

119
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,965
All right, let's eat.

120
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,050
Yes, sir.

121
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,101
Let me say this again, just in case.

122
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,603
No one else can know
about this place but us.

123
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,438
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

124
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,066
How's the search for Kang Daeil going?

125
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,150
Any progress?

126
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,861
Yes,
we're tracing him through his crew.

127
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,655
We should be able to pin him down soon.

128
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,031
We have to find him.

129
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,408
Yes, sir. Understood.

130
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,287
Apparently, Jo Manjae had his hands
in every racket and made a fortune.

131
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,914
Smuggling, for starters,

132
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,709
siphoning US army supplies,
real estate speculation…

133
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,211
Even the toilet paper
in government offices

134
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,004
has to pass through his hands.

135
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,297
He ate all that up by himself?

136
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,925
Mm-mmm… He couldn't have.

137
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,803
I mean, look. We can't even
have a meal without sharing.

138
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,556
You think he can hog the whole thing? How?

139
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,724
He's got backing.

140
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,892
Mr. Jang.

141
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,644
You think that's the KCIA, right?

142
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,981
The KCIA doing business with gangsters?
That's nothing new.

143
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,107
I'm not even surprised.

144
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,568
But why do you think they took Jo Manjae?

145
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,279
I bet he pulled something shady.

146
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,156
That must be why they hauled him in.

147
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,867
They chopped off the tail.
Cut him off like this.

148
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,785
What? You think they killed him?

149
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,038
Jo Manjae paid up
massive sums to the KCIA.

150
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,417
And that money went straight
into Director Hwang's safe.

151
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,088
Some of it probably went
further up the chain too.

152
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,049
You mean there's someone above Hwang?

153
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,927
- That's right.
- And who could it be?

154
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,513
Well, I don't know that yet.

155
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,891
But the election's right
around the corner,

156
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,517
and plenty of places need funding.

157
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,104
I'm sure they'll restart his operations
by rounding up the rest of his gang.

158
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,484
To do that, they must've kept
either Jo Manjae or Kang Daeil alive.

159
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,611
And you think it's Kang Daeil, right?

160
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,698
We've got a shot
only if Kang Daeil's alive.

161
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,300
My legs…

162
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,825
I haven't seen you around before.

163
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,452
I work under Director Hwang.

164
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,417
But there's no future

165
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,753
working under Hwang.

166
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,674
Maybe under Cheon,
that would be different.

167
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,599
If you're interested,

168
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,686
I can help you.

169
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,313
What do you mean?

170
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,109
Let's meet somewhere quiet later.

171
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,735
Just the two of us.

172
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,619
I had him under me for a bit

173
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,996
in the army.

174
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,080
He's pretty useful.

175
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,791
His eyes are practically dripping
with ambition.

176
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,961
Maybe it's from growing up with nothing.

177
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,630
- But he knows his place.
- I'm getting tipsy. Give me one.

178
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,341
They make quite the pair.

179
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,926
Not a bad pick.

180
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,012
Thank you, sir.

181
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,225
Geumji. Bae Geumji…

182
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,353
I can't get a read
on how that woman's going to play this.

183
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,772
You want me to kill her?

184
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm sorry, sir.

185
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,822
Don't do anything stupid.

186
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,868
Just have him stick close to her for now.

187
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,662
Keep an eye on her
so she can't pull anything.

188
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,498
Yes, sir.

189
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,276
<i>That woman's got a notebook.</i>

190
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,864
A list of all the men she's slept with.

191
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,867
Which means the kid's father
has to be in there.

192
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,455
Now, what's the real issue?
Who the father is?

193
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,041
That's not the real issue.

194
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,504
Damn it.

195
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,681
What matters isn't who the father is.

196
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,432
It's that

197
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,061
all those men whose names are
in that notebook are losing sleep,

198
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,271
wondering if the boy is theirs.

199
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,773
That's the real problem.

200
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,943
Can we trust that information?

201
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,361
Of course.

202
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,781
The guy who gave it to me?
His name's in that notebook too.

203
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,701
You'd better keep your head straight.

204
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,953
She's the kind men fall for
at first sight.

205
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,746
You don't have to worry about me, sir.

206
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,957
Ashtray.

207
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,255
Be careful, all right?

208
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,426
You wouldn't want your name
ending up in that notebook too.

209
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,644
I swear,

210
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,356
I don't get why everyone's dying
to sink their teeth into me.

211
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,736
Did Director Hwang ask you
to get the notebook?

212
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,739
What notebook?

213
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,909
You must be curious,

214
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,455
being the only one left in the dark.

215
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,332
I'm not interested.

216
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,585
Really?

217
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,172
Because I could tell you right now

218
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,798
who the father really is.

219
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,516
But you're not interested, right?

220
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,311
Are you messing with me?

221
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,771
Oh, no.

222
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,522
You thought I was
actually going to tell you?

223
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,401
You're adorable.

224
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,282
Anyway, I'm never going back
to the States,

225
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,076
so tell them to quit dreaming.

226
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,327
I'm staying right here.

227
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,163
Maybe even date a handsome guy like you.

228
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,208
Aren't you sick of men by now?

229
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,587
Depends on who the man is.

230
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,219
Since we're here,
why don't we be straight with each other?

231
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,265
If you don't feel like talking
about dating, we can talk business.

232
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,726
Business?

233
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,313
I told you the other day, didn't I?

234
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,024
I could help you.

235
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,486
Help me with what?
And how exactly?

236
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,870
Look who's finally showing some interest.

237
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,048
Being the President's right-hand man
or whatever…

238
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,758
Who cares about that crap?

239
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,345
What matters is

240
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,097
how you got there.

241
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,142
You know well

242
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,478
how Hwang managed to get as far as he did,

243
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,896
don't you?

244
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:15,529
Now, just think how much more
Cheon must've passed up above him.

245
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,115
An endless stream of cash.

246
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,160
That's the real source of their power.

247
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,292
So…

248
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,420
If you had your hands on that stream,

249
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,714
who's to say

250
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,134
you couldn't get to Cheon's level,
not just Hwang's?

251
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:38,927
Am I right?

252
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,721
Mr. Baek.

253
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,182
Tell me what you want.

254
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,809
I'll help you.

255
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,439
I heard you've got ties
to the Japanese yakuza.

256
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,983
Chairman Ikeda.

257
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,903
Have you ever met him?

258
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,905
Boss!

259
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,536
<i>No.</i>

260
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,373
But I did catch a glimpse
of his daughter once.

261
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
Ikeda Yuji.

262
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,128
Real name, Choi Yuji.

263
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,588
Yes, Choi Yuji.

264
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,841
How did you know she's Korean?

265
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,676
I've met her myself once.

266
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,431
<i>If only she weren't of Korean descent,</i>

267
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,892
<i>she might have even had a shot
at being his successor.</i>

268
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,687
<i>She's a </i>Zainichi<i>, but he still</i>
<i>took her in as his foster daughter.</i>

269
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,149
<i>I don't know how she won his favor,</i>

270
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,193
<i>but he clearly treasures her.</i>

271
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,702
Anyway, I'm certain she's one
of the real powers in the Ikeda clan.

272
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,997
How on earth do you know all this?

273
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,877
So, what about Choi Yuji?

274
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,465
I think… …I need to see her again.

275
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,718
Okay.

276
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,599
Call me, Mr. Baek.

277
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,576
Guys, this is Lee Sunyeong.

278
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,620
She's a new member of Rose Club.

279
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,788
Say hello.

280
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,040
Hi, nice to meet you all.

281
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,419
I'm Lee Sunyeong.

282
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,588
I'm not very good with my hands though.

283
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,050
Anyway, I'm excited to be here.

284
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,012
Come on,
no one's good from the start.

285
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,513
- Welcome to the club.
- Thanks.

286
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,098
Here, try knitting this first.

287
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,934
Hi, Soyeong.

288
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,561
You got off work a bit late today.

289
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,729
Yeah.

290
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,273
Oh, I see you guys have already started.

291
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,734
Soyeong, did you get
what I asked for last time?

292
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,736
Yeah,
I brought the information sheet.

293
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:06,366
It's a three-year term
with an annual interest rate of 17.4%…

294
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,994
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much, Soyeong.

295
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,124
Are you from Seoul?

296
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,918
Sorry?

297
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,339
You don't seem to have a Busan accent.

298
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:25,093
That's because
Soyeong grew up in Japan.

299
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,346
Soyeong, say hello.

300
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,058
This is Lee Sunyeong.
She's a new member of the club.

301
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,726
Of course.

302
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,188
No wonder you've got
such great skin.

303
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,274
My goodness. How's your skin so smooth?

304
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,527
Oh, you're too kind.

305
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,489
Well, I was just born with it.

306
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,449
You're so lucky.

307
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,745
My uncle lives in Japan too. In Osaka.

308
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,122
No way! I lived in Osaka too!

309
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,832
Oh, my goodness.

310
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,960
What are the chances?

311
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,673
- Wow, you work at a bank?
- Oh, yeah.

312
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,052
What do you do
for a living, Sunyeong?

313
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
Well…

314
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,431
My parents run…
What do you call that again?

315
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,849
They run a metal shop…

316
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,769
…so I help out with my older brothers.

317
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,729
What about you, Soyeong?

318
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,106
Do you have an older brother?

319
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,816
Yeah.

320
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,444
Well, I've never told you guys,

321
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,489
but my brother could give Shin Seongil
a run for his money.

322
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,074
My brother looks like Alain Delon!

323
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,326
Really? We have so much in common!

324
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
Wow,
are they really that handsome?

325
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,540
- You should bring him here sometime.
- Oh, I can't do that. He's busy.

326
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,708
- Bring him.
- I've got to see with my own eyes.

327
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,086
- He must be really handsome.
- You bet.

328
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,339
The Vietnam War, huh?

329
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,632
PERSONAL RECORD
NAME: BAEK KITAE

330
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,842
Yes.

331
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,387
He was in the Special Warfare Command
but got dishonorably discharged there.

332
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,931
It seems like there was
some kind of incident.

333
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,561
Sir, I heard rumors
you got the Order of Military Merit,

334
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,020
but that's not true, right?

335
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,446
Well…

336
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,494
I mean, it was from the government,

337
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,080
so I couldn't exactly refuse.

338
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,124
Seriously?

339
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,169
There were three armed guerrillas.

340
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,088
Armed guerrillas?

341
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,007
You going to tell me you've been shot too?

342
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,091
Here.

343
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,093
- Here.
- Wait.

344
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,762
Are you actually telling me
this is from a gunshot?

345
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,639
- It went in here and…
- Yeah?

346
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,726
- I'm not sure if you can see it. Here.
- Whoa, what?

347
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,894
Wait a second.

348
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,354
So it went in here and came out here?

349
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,316
Wow, so it's true!

350
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,067
You're incredible, Mr. Jang.

351
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,196
Well, they wouldn't have
given me the medal if I weren't.

352
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,284
Oh, my.

353
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,620
My goodness.

354
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,288
Oh, my…

355
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,250
Mr. Jang, you must work out all the time.

356
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,794
Yeah, well, I just do some push-ups.

357
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,213
Of course.

358
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,256
No wonder you look so good in your suits.

359
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,217
How many do you do?

360
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,761
A hundred? Yeah, about a hundred.

361
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,096
So, how did it go?

362
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,640
Did you meet her?

363
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm so tired.

364
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,106
It's true they grew up in Osaka, Japan.

365
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,858
- They're <i>Zainichi</i>?
- Yes.

366
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,277
They came back to Korea
after their parents passed.

367
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,738
Apparently, they had a tough time
settling down here.

368
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,324
Then Baek Kitae must've had
to play the parent.

369
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,034
He did
every kind of job imaginable

370
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,827
to support his younger siblings.

371
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,539
And being <i>Zainichi</i>,
he went through a lot of discrimination.

372
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,249
So he became a career soldier?

373
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,709
There's actually another soldier
in the family.

374
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,379
Their younger brother, Baek Kihyun.

375
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,799
He graduated top of his class
from the Military Academy.

376
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,301
Now, he's serving up front
as a second lieutenant.

377
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,013
The older brother's in the KCIA,
and the younger one's from the Academy?

378
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,558
Well, talk about rising from nothing.

379
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,020
But it sounded like something happened
to the younger brother when he was a kid.

380
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,522
What happened?

381
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:09,859
Well, Baek Soyeong didn't go into detail,
but she seemed really worried about him.

382
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,279
Okay.

383
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,906
So, are you meeting her again?

384
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,867
Yes, we hit it off and decided
to grab a meal together sometime.

385
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,870
Also, Kang Daeil?

386
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,789
He's alive.

387
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,377
You've tracked him down?

388
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,256
Not exactly. But word is,
he's putting the gang back together.

389
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,591
He's even looking for a chemist.

390
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,594
See? I told you,
Kang Daeil, that bastard, is alive.

391
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,179
Your instincts are spot-on, sir.

392
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,764
I'm telling you,

393
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,892
Kang Daeil is tied up with the KCIA.

394
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,190
The KCIA can take down
anyone in their sights.

395
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,360
Mr. Jang, if you push too far
and things go sideways--

396
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,154
I'll take the fall.

397
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,197
If anyone loses their job,
it's going to be me.

398
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:12,088
OSAKA, JAPAN

399
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,216
You have guests from Korea.

400
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,879
Long time no see, Ms. Bae.

401
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,382
It's good to see you, Ms. Ikeda.

402
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,510
It's been a while, Mr. Matsuda.

403
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,555
Or should I call you
Mr. Baek Kitae now?

404
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,724
I'm Baek Kitae.

405
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,935
It's good to see you.

406
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,821
You've got
a lovely little place here.

407
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,701
How's the chairman doing?

408
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,495
I heard he hasn't been well.

409
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,456
Is your son doing well?

410
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,713
He's… just like his father.

411
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,632
That's good.

412
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,093
When are you going back to America?

413
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,803
I'm not going back.

414
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,638
I've got some things to do in Korea.

415
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,101
And I've met someone I like.

416
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,104
You haven't eaten, right?

417
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,272
Gosh, I'm starving.

418
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,899
I heard there's
a famous sushi place nearby.

419
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,777
I actually made a reservation there
when I heard you were coming.

420
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,407
Darling, you like sushi, right?
This is great.

421
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,659
Mr. Baek, you should have
a drink with me instead.

422
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,536
I have something to discuss in private.

423
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,289
My staff will escort you, Ms. Bae.

424
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,083
You've done your part.

425
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,544
Now, it's Mr. Baek's turn
to finish things.

426
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,257
I'm sure he didn't come all this way
just to have some sushi with me.

427
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,634
Am I right, Mr. Baek?

428
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,432
Does Ms. Bae know why we're meeting?

429
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,226
No.

430
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,896
She wouldn't have the faintest idea.

431
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,523
So you want to do business with me
in Jo Manjae's place?

432
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,650
A senior KCIA agent himself?

433
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,652
Is that a problem?

434
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,987
Does Director Hwang know?

435
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,822
Does he need to?

436
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,659
By the way… …how do you know him?

437
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,411
I used to work with him.

438
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,079
On what?

439
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,831
Just some business.

440
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,589
"Chairman of the Korea-Japan
Cultural Exchange Foundation."

441
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,092
"Director of the Korea-Japan
Development Council."

442
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,971
Since when do yakuza
do this kind of thing?

443
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,439
We do anything that makes money,

444
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,774
just like you.

445
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,154
Are you serious about doing this right?

446
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,657
If we're not doing it right,

447
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,159
then I'm not doing it at all.

448
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,760
If you don't hold up your end again,

449
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,889
I'll make sure you pay for it,
even for wasting my time.

450
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,518
That sounds like a threat.

451
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
It is a threat.

452
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,357
If you can't handle it, walk away.

453
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,121
Let me ask you one thing.

454
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,626
Did you want to see me?

455
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,755
I wanted to see you.

456
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,847
Mr. Baek!

457
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,312
Darling,
were you okay without me?

458
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,856
Did you enjoy shopping, Ms. Bae?

459
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,651
Yeah, I picked up a few briefs
for my dear Mr. Baek.

460
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,548
HAPPY BUSAN CITIZENS' DAY

461
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,678
Hello, Director Hwang.

462
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,973
Jang Geonyoung,
Special Investigations, Busan Office.

463
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,809
Oh, right.

464
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,315
I heard you've been working hard
chasing after those junkies.

465
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,733
Me? Not at all.

466
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,277
You're the one
who must have it rough, sir.

467
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,238
With all the big names in Busan
in the palm of your hand,

468
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,575
I can only imagine
how much work that takes.

469
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,747
I don't know what you've heard exactly.

470
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,249
But narcotics cases?

471
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,752
You just end up
chasing the tail all night.

472
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,214
- You've got your share of headaches.
- That's why

473
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,841
I was hoping to ask you for some intel.

474
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,635
What kind of intel?

475
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,762
You know Jo Manjae well, right?

476
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,889
The Manjae Gang boss.

477
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,725
Well, I guess
I know about as much as you do.

478
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,894
But I was told

479
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,272
he disappeared. Isn't that right?

480
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,607
Yes, that's right.

481
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,985
He did disappear, without a trace.

482
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,029
But just when I started
investigating again,

483
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,200
a witness pops up saying they'd seen him
in the Philippines.

484
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,287
And the next thing I know,
the higher-ups shut it all down.

485
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,541
So what exactly is it

486
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,502
that you want to know?

487
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,214
Whether he's alive in the Philippines

488
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,425
or rotting somewhere, that can wait.

489
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,220
But who has taken over his operation

490
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,682
and is running
the drug trade here in Busan?

491
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,227
That's what I want to know.

492
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,777
That's news to me.

493
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,071
Someone's definitely taken it over.

494
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,573
I'm sure of it.

495
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,578
Rounding up the leftover goons,

496
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,289
and trying to bring in a new cook.

497
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,919
By the way,

498
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,589
I don't see your guy here. Baek Kitae?

499
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,923
He's usually with you.

500
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,968
I guess the KCIA
must be swamped these days.

501
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,349
You're good at peeling these.

502
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,851
I can never get it right.

503
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,686
Is that so?

504
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,814
- Want me to peel one for you?
- Would you?

505
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
Sure.

506
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,861
Here.

507
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,696
You grab the legs

508
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,908
and peel it off like this.

509
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:37,992
There.

510
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,036
- For you, sir.
- Thanks.

511
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,085
- Go ahead.
- All right.

512
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,425
Mr. Jang!

513
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,721
How did it go?

514
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,350
Seeing how he played dumb,

515
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,393
it's clear the KCIA
took care of Jo Manjae.

516
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,814
So, does that mean
Director Hwang killed him off

517
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,982
and is pushing meth himself?

518
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,904
I don't think Director Hwang
knows much about the drugs.

519
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,826
Then who the hell is it?

520
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,828
When are you meeting Baek Soyeong?

521
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,792
Do you think…

522
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,213
Baek Kitae is trying to push meth
behind Hwang's back?

523
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,006
I threw it out there,

524
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,300
so let's wait and see

525
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,054
if Baek Kitae is really running drugs.

526
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,642
Have you lost your mind?

527
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,228
A KCIA agent dealing meth?

528
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,355
What are you thinking? Huh?

529
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,315
Are you trying to get us all killed?

530
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,946
I'm doing this so we can all survive.

531
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,742
After Mom died,

532
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,121
how did the three of us make it to Busan?

533
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,998
And what's our life been like?

534
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,501
If we keep living like this,
nothing will be different in 10, 20 years.

535
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,712
We'll never get out
of this damn hillside slum.

536
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,631
Soyeong.

537
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,592
Don't you trust me?

538
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,804
Say I bring in just one kilo.
That costs 200,000 won.

539
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,558
Cook it and sell it, that's 5 million.
Ship it to Japan, 15 million.

540
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,269
Fif…

541
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,106
Fifteen million won?

542
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,693
Plus, I'm not doing this alone.

543
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,236
People above me…

544
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,657
We're all in on it.

545
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,784
Above you? The KCIA?

546
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,578
How high up?

547
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,038
Way up.

548
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,917
Which means
there's no risk of getting caught.

549
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,127
No.

550
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,005
There will be addicts.

551
00:36:56,505 --> 00:37:00,301
It'll wreck the country, right when
they're trying to build a new era.

552
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,055
Kitae, no, I'd feel too guilty.

553
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,557
You don't have to worry about that.

554
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,684
We'll make it here,

555
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,436
but we'll ship it all out to Japan.

556
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,355
Japan?

557
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,315
Yeah. We'll be
bringing in foreign currency,

558
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,442
and we'll be the ones driving exports.

559
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,444
If the business goes well,

560
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,030
we'll be doing our part
in building the new era.

561
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,782
Our family won't be left behind.

562
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,117
We'll be at the forefront
if we get with the times.

563
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,203
That means we're serving the country.

564
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,329
It's patriotic work.

565
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,081
Patriotic?

566
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,166
Yes.

567
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,963
Don't tell Kihyun.
He doesn't need to know.

568
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,298
Okay.

569
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,427
You just need to take care of the money

570
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,681
and keep an eye on Kang Daeil, all right?

571
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,773
Yeah. Thank you, sir.

572
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,076
Our goal…

573
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,289
is to make the best product

574
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,999
and take over the Japanese market.

575
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,461
What about Korea?

576
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,172
Focus on Japan for now.

577
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,299
Don't put anything out in Korea
without my approval.

578
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,800
Understood.

579
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,014
What about the chemist?

580
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,352
We've got someone
with sharp eyes and skilled hands.

581
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,979
He's made quite a name
for himself in this business.

582
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,315
It wasn't easy,
but I managed to bring him in.

583
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:23,986
The best of the best, as pure as possible.

584
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,866
That's how we win the Japanese over.

585
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,034
You know that, right?

586
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,660
Understood, sir.

587
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,708
And I'm bringing one more person on board.

588
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,836
Who is it?

589
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,506
The place has a nice view.

590
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,801
Right. Yeah, very nice.

591
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,393
Let's do this!

592
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,105
Yeah, let's do this!

593
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,335
All right, the pigs are here.

594
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,849
Okay, let's go.

595
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,104
Come on, let's go.

596
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,983
Go on, get in there.

597
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,950
They stink bad, huh?

598
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,034
It's fine.

599
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,418
Here, this will help.

600
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,387
I'm Kang Daeil.

601
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,556
I've heard a lot about you.

602
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,600
If it ever gets tough, just let me know.

603
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,684
Tough? No way.

604
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,227
This is patriotic work after all.

605
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,355
Patriotic?

606
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,025
That's nice.

607
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,487
Man, smells real sweet.

608
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,489
Make sure they have plenty to eat!

609
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,746
We've got the pigs here.

610
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,997
You want to get started?

611
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,924
Mr. Kang.

612
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,009
I have a question.

613
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,552
Why did you bring pigs here?

614
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,346
They cost money, don't they?

615
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,849
It stinks when you cook meth, you know.

616
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,934
And?

617
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,269
You cover it with the smell of pig crap.

618
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,314
Hey.

619
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,696
Hey.

620
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,032
What?

621
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,263
DIRECTOR GENERAL HWANG GUKPYEONG

622
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,475
This month's take looks a little light.

623
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,565
Kang Daeil's still trying
to pull the gang back together, so…

624
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,570
Fine. More importantly,

625
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,781
who did she meet in Osaka?

626
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,952
Bae Geumji.

627
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,038
No one in particular.

628
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,708
She just went shopping and sightseeing.

629
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,626
Shopping, huh?

630
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,129
And I'm losing my mind over here.

631
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,007
Where's that tramp now?

632
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,051
She's staying with her family
to take care of her kid.

633
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,304
Lee's keeping an eye on her now.

634
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,097
I'll be taking over again tomorrow.

635
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,433
Right, I appreciate it.

636
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,145
Phone in every two hours.

637
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:27,896
Yes, sir.

638
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,275
You can go.

639
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,962
Yes, sir.

640
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,756
Send Pyo in.

641
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,091
Yes, sir. I will.

642
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,218
Mr. Pyo, he'll see you now.

643
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,317
- Did you find out?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,570
Baek Kitae met with Ikeda Yuji in Osaka.

645
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,530
Choi Yuji?

646
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,615
Yes, sir.

647
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,452
Baek Kitae…

648
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,038
met with Choi Yuji?

649
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,415
That little bastard.

650
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,502
I told him to shut down the meth business…

651
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,338
…and now he's going all in on it?

652
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,300
It looks like he and Kang Daeil
have taken over the whole Manjae Gang.

653
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,682
I guess I've been raising
a tiger all along, huh?

654
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:50,854
If word gets out the KCIA's pushing meth,
it'll be a hell of a show, won't it?

655
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,402
Sir.

656
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,405
But the thing is,

657
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,617
I hear the profits are massive.

658
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,078
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

659
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,339
How much are we talking?

660
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,176
I'll get back to you with exact numbers.

661
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,946
What did you pray for?

662
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,907
The country's well-being
and world peace.

663
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,287
I'm serious.

664
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,915
Don't you ever pray?

665
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,712
Does He ever answer your prayers?

666
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,089
Of course.

667
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,926
If you really want it
with all your heart, He does.

668
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,724
Ms. Bae,
what is it that you really want?

669
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,941
Does the notebook even exist?

670
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,950
What about you? What do you really want?

671
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,496
Money?

672
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,414
Power?

673
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:34,708
Love?

674
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,549
You want it all, don't you?

675
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,844
So no one can ever look down on you.

676
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,684
So do I.

677
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:55,979
Same as you.

678
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,571
Fucking hell.

679
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,450
Bow properly, damn it!

680
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,793
Hello?

681
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,545
Hey, where the hell are you?

682
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,879
Where's Bae Geumji?

683
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,257
She's attending church service.

684
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,968
<i>That bitch wants
to see the President today!</i>

685
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,347
<i>He'll be inspecting
Seoul National University in a bit,</i>

686
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,016
<i>and that crazy bitch is planning
to show up there!</i>

687
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,352
Hey!

688
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,397
If you lose her, you and I are finished.
You get that, right?

689
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,858
<i>You get that or not, you little shit?</i>

690
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,957
Bae Geumji!

691
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,303
<i>Na Yongcheol,
Chief of Staff to the President.</i>

692
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,849
<i>Cheon Seokjung's sole rival
and his closest enemy.</i>

693
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,186
You think you can just pop out a kid
and turn your life around?

694
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,774
Well,
I figured I'd give it a try.

695
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,611
See if it works.

696
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,906
There's only one kid.

697
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,241
How many fathers does he have?

698
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,161
You looking to milk everyone dry?

699
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,875
You and I

700
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:41,919
both know

701
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,962
who the father is.

702
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,839
What matters isn't the truth.

703
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,425
What matters is

704
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,720
what people believe, Mr. Na.

705
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:55,349
Either way, they all believe
what they want to believe.

706
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,017
And?

707
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,771
You're just going to let them believe it?

708
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,566
Why not? It doesn't hurt me.

709
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,362
There's no reason for me to run around
telling people the whole story, is there?

710
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,156
Well,
if it bothers you that much,

711
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,743
why don't you go ahead
and tell them yourself?

712
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,871
So the country can go to hell,
as long as you save your own skin?

713
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,706
All those men you're stirring up

714
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,834
are those working hard
to keep this country going.

715
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:23,919
Exactly.

716
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,755
Which is why I'm asking for your help.

717
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,634
I want to be able
to care about the country too.

718
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,718
You know,

719
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,763
you could really end up dead
if you keep this up.

720
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,849
Don't you know any of them could easily
get rid of someone like you?

721
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,814
Doesn't matter.

722
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,025
No matter what anyone says,
I'm not leaving.

723
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,904
So help me.

724
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,705
Come on. After everything…

725
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,085
I can ask you that much, can't I?

726
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:08,588
Truth is,

727
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,550
I've been thinking
of starting my own business.

728
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,136
I've always wanted to.

729
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,931
A courtesan house, bigger than Cheonungak.

730
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,891
How does that sound?

731
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,853
I've already got my eye
on the building and the land.

732
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,400
And I think I'd like a villa too.
Everyone else has one.

733
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,111
What do you think?

734
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:38,994
Mr. Na.

735
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,081
Don't take this lightly.

736
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,752
Because everything I said today?

737
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,256
I meant every word.

738
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,636
You crazy bitch.

739
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,346
Are you threatening me right now?

740
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,361
So, you're saying…

741
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,740
She went to see

742
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,493
Chief Na, not the President?

743
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,827
Yes, sir.

744
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,537
That crazy bitch.

745
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,209
She's digging her own grave, isn't she?

746
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,379
What about Baek?

747
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,965
He's standing by in Seoul.

748
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,261
Goddamn idiot,
falling for some tramp like that.

749
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,768
Still, the woman's a real piece of work.

750
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,813
She just had to stir up the hornet's nest

751
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,483
and throw all the men upstairs into chaos.

752
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,362
I can't tell if she's naïve
or just plain stupid.

753
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,700
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?

754
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,786
Have you ever been in love?

755
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,873
I'm not so sure.

756
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,340
She's pulling all this shit
just because she wants to be loved.

757
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,935
Fucking bitch.

758
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,438
<i>That's right.</i>

759
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,984
<i>This was the night I last saw him.</i>

760
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,613
<i>It was the first time
he'd ever asked to meet,</i>

761
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,700
<i>so I wondered what it was about.</i>

762
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,833
Darling.

763
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,170
Are you mad at me?

764
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,177
Go back.

765
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,804
Are you really going to do this?

766
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,056
You're ruining the mood.

767
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,443
Those guys can't do anything to me.

768
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,571
I've got my notebook.

769
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,824
Hand that over and get out of the country

770
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,826
if you want to stay alive.

771
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,662
If I hand that over…

772
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,124
they'll kill me.

773
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,251
And they'll kill you if you don't.

774
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,884
Why are you trying to scare me like this?

775
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,562
Enough games.

776
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,065
Hand over the notebook, now.

777
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,442
And if I don't?

778
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,862
You might not make it through the night.

779
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,825
My God.

780
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,870
How do you even make threats look so cool?

781
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,249
Do you practice in front of a mirror
or something?

782
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,586
Gosh, that hurt.

783
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,512
It never existed.

784
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,767
The notebook.

785
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,644
It never existed.

786
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,521
I'm telling you the truth

787
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,524
because I think you figured that out
a long time ago.

788
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,119
Stay with me tonight.

789
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,248
I don't want to be alone.

790
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,084
You said I might not make it
through the night.

791
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,670
If something happens to me,

792
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,673
you'll have to save me.

793
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,805
Why should I do that?

794
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,061
You think I don't know?

795
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,693
About whatever deal
you've got going with Choi Yuji.

796
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,904
Did you think I wouldn't figure it out?

797
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,705
You can't do this to me.

798
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,874
You…

799
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,375
Darling.

800
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,378
You like me, don't you?

801
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,567
Mr. Baek.

802
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,444
Darling.

803
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,034
Hey, Seongguk's birthday is…

804
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,452
Next Saturday.

805
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,666
How about we take him to Changgyeongwon?

806
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,586
And show him the elephants.

807
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,214
Geumji,
we should stop this now.

808
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,092
Let's go back to the States
with Seongguk, all right?

809
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,595
I'll do whatever it takes
to raise him well.

810
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,140
Aren't you angry?

811
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,604
I am.

812
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,649
At this world.

813
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,465
Hey. Get out of the car, punk.

814
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,883
Who the hell are you?

815
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,843
- Get out of the car.
- Who the hell are you?

816
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,428
- Come on.
- Let go! Let go of me!

817
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,806
- Walk straight, you bastard!
- Who the hell are you?

818
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,266
- Hey, get him in.
- Hey! Damn it.

819
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,643
- Get off me!
- Get the hell in!

820
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,118
What's going on? You scared me.

821
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,125
<i>Can't you just let me go?</i>

822
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,691
<i>I wanted to fall in love again.</i>

823
