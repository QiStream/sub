=The Truth=

00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:14,136
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,669
Jiang Lianhong, take a look.

4
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,669
I said she looked like...

5
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,270
He Jie.

6
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:26,669
You mean

7
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,669
the He Jie you raped 20 years ago?

8
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,470
What's He Jie's

9
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:34,270
connection to Jiang Honghai?

10
00:01:36,589 --> 00:01:38,270
I've told you everything I know.

11
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,029
Go arrest him.

12
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:40,669
Why do you keep questioning me?

13
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,070
Then let's start with this.

14
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:51,990
Who is this?

15
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,309
It's too blurry. I can't see clearly.

16
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,669
What?

17
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,584
You forgot who you ate with that day?

18
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:05,470
Jiang Han.

19
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,869
Does he know Jiang Honghai too?

20
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:09,709
We're from the same village.

21
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:10,350
He's a mason.

22
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,870
He referred all the masons.

23
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,470
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

24
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,549
I didn't know he was involved in this.

25
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,709
Check this guy out.

26
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:27,829
What's Jiang Honghai's

27
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,509
connection to the rape case

28
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:30,590
22 years ago?

29
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,989
That day, a lot of police
came to my place.

30
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:36,709
All there to arrest me.

31
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:38,669
They said I got a young girl

32
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:39,829
pregnant.

33
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,829
But I never did it.

34
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,470
I didn't even know her.

35
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,870
But that kid described everything
about me clearly.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,150
She even had my underwear.

37
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,509
I only found out later

38
00:02:58,269 --> 00:02:59,989
that Honghai was behind that.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,709
It was all planned.

40
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,269
You're saying

41
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,870
Jiang Honghai and He Jie

42
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,070
colluded to frame you?

43
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,310
Not just them.

44
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,310
Honghai's dad too.

45
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,870
And my own dad.

46
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:23,549
Then why would the victim
falsely accuse you?

47
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:26,590
Honghai was 25 that year.

48
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,030
He got her pregnant

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,630
and secretly took her
to get an abortion.

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,034
He Jie's parents called the police.

51
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,070
Honghai couldn't go to jail.

52
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,789
So he and He Jie

53
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,549
threw the blame on me

54
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,350
while his dad came to see my dad.

55
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:51,430
His dad was a village official.

56
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,630
He turned everyone against me.

57
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:57,509
Even the police were fooled.

58
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,229
My family couldn't fight them.

59
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,669
Later, he gave us 20,000 yuan

60
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,590
and an acre of land.

61
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,630
(My dad told me...)

62
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,790
"Son,

63
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,990
just admit it."

64
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,630
She's all settled in.

65
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,430
Don't worry.

66
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,550
We almost caught him.

67
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,750
I should've anticipated his next move.

68
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:54,149
His target has been Chen Xiaomeng.

69
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:57,870
Calm down.

70
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,469
How can I calm down?

71
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,589
He almost succeeded.

72
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,070
He's a murderer, a rapist.

73
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,949
As I've already said,

74
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:07,870
we've sent people
to protect Chen Xiaomeng.

75
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,389
Let's head back.

76
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,070
Captain Leng might have new leads.

77
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,230
Let's go. I'll drive.

78
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:20,310
Let's go.

79
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:42,589
Captain Leng.

80
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,349
We got something.

81
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,070
Jiang Han, 40 years old,
no prior record.

82
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,589
He also grew up in the village.

83
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,550
He's around the same age
as Jiang Lianhong.

84
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,269
He teaches at a mason training school

85
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,190
and helps young villagers find work.

86
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,349
Bring Jiang Han in immediately.

87
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,349
See if we can get

88
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,589
new leads from him.

89
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,750
Focus on finding Jiang Honghai.

90
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:04,070
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

91
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,864
(Ye Qian: Chen Xiaomeng is safe.)

92
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,990
Should be here.

93
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,750
Jiang Han?

94
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,349
City Police Department.

95
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:25,389
A few questions.

96
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,349
I'm just a trainer.

97
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,310
Conditions in our village aren't good.

98
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,870
Many young guys rely on this skill

99
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,949
to make a living.

100
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,990
(Yunxi Police)
Did you refer Jiang Lianhong too?

101
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,790
Jiang Lianhong?

102
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,230
We do manual labor,

103
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,230
but jobs aren't easy to find now.

104
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,509
But he got lucky.

105
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,870
Met some good people.

106
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,790
Someone pulled strings
to pay his training fees.

107
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,709
Later on,

108
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,709
they even gave him jobs
on construction sites.

109
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:56,949
Who was that person?

110
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,310
Jiang Honghai.

111
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,990
His family used to be
in the renovation business.

112
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,750
They're pretty well-off.

113
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,509
His dad used to be a village official.

114
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,110
Most of the fishponds

115
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,589
in our village belong to his family.

116
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:09,149
Right.

117
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,430
Honghai has this habit.

118
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:12,990
He loves making soup
with live brood fish.

119
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:14,349
Says it's nourishing.

120
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,990
He has it every single day.

121
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,550
So, he always keeps
a fish tank where he lives.

122
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,509
Every few days,

123
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,230
he has his family
deliver fresh brood fish to him.

124
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,949
You may not know.

125
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,709
Brood fish are really expensive.

126
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,829
Luckily, his family has fishponds.

127
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,550
Or who could've afforded that?

128
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:32,990
(Yunxi Police)

129
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,310
On May 25th,

130
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,430
where were you
between 10 PM and midnight?

131
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,750
May 25th?

132
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:39,949
Let me think.

133
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,430
That night,
I was drinking at a restaurant.

134
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,750
Who were you drinking with?

135
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,670
Jiang Lianhong and Jiang Honghai.

136
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,790
But Jiang Honghai can't hold his liquor.

137
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,190
He was clamoring to leave before 11 PM.

138
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,149
I drank for a bit longer
and then left too.

139
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,829
Didn't pay attention to the exact time.

140
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,589
Did you see Jiang Honghai again
after that?

141
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:00,750
No.

142
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,670
Besides home and construction sites,

143
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,550
does Jiang Honghai

144
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,750
have any other places to stay?

145
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,469
Jiang Honghai is a strange one.

146
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,070
He's used to keeping to himself.

147
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,269
But I have a storage warehouse.

148
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,630
A year ago, he asked me for its key

149
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,630
and wanted to keep
construction equipment there.

150
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,430
He hasn't returned the key yet.

151
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,389
Where is that warehouse?

152
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,469
28, North Xinyuan Lane.

153
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,389
In the abandoned place
by the noodle shop.

154
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,109
We got something.

155
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:43,829
Jiang Honghai also drank
with them that night.

156
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:44,709
And he left first.

157
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,629
Wang Tong,

158
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,872
share the address.

159
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:47,430
Yes.

160
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,989
Let's go.

161
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:13,510
Master,

162
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,510
this building's abandoned.

163
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:16,869
Lights on the second floor.

164
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,070
Target is likely there.

165
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,550
Standard procedure.

166
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,390
Wang Tong.

167
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,510
- You take point.
- Okay.

168
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,270
You provide backup.

169
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,790
We secure the perimeter.

170
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,390
Get down.

171
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,709
Don't move.

172
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,109
Jiang Lianhong wanted to cover for you

173
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,629
and take the blame for you.

174
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:38,430
Did you know that?

175
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,390
He...

176
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:46,869
he might have been

177
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:49,469
doing it for his dad.

178
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,352
(Dual usage of devices
is strictly prohibited)

179
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,229
Why protect Jiang Honghai?

180
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:07,229
My dad has uremia.

181
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:08,709
He needs dialysis.

182
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,109
I had no choice.

183
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,349
Once, when we were drunk,

184
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,510
he told me,

185
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:19,709
"Lianhong,

186
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,150
if anything ever happens to you,

187
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:25,229
I'll take care of your dad
until the end."

188
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,469
Well,

189
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:30,550
my life is worthless.

190
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,469
Whether I live or die doesn't matter.

191
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,550
Back then, you seduced He Jie

192
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,510
and got her pregnant at just 13.

193
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,310
After her parents found out,

194
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:44,070
you forced her to commit perjury

195
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:47,510
and pinned all the blame
on Jiang Lianhong.

196
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,270
Now you've committed these three crimes.

197
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:52,390
You've destroyed five families.

198
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,264
(Dual usage of devices
is strictly prohibited)

199
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:10,270
Why target them?

200
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:21,550
Jiang Honghai,

201
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:24,270
you won't get away this time.

202
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,949
No one can take the fall for you.

203
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,869
You reap what you sow.

204
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,270
The law will get you.

205
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:31,896
(Jiang Honghai finally pleaded guilty
in the face of evidence.)

206
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,176
(For the case of his false accusation
against Jiang Lianhong 22 years ago,)

207
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:34,584
(Yunxi Police Department has established
a task force for further investigation.)

208
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,270
Qian.

209
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,949
We've finally delivered justice
for the victims.

210
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,430
But that's far from enough.

211
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,349
Ye Qian,

212
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,229
you need to learn to channel that energy

213
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:12,430
in the right direction.

214
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,150
So the suffering before

215
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:15,949
won't have been in vain.

216
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,349
Understood, master.

217
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,229
Keep it up.

218
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,629
Here, have some jasmine tea.

219
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:25,469
It'll cool you down.

220
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:23,349
We got him.

221
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,430
Did he say why?

222
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,150
He chose victims randomly.

223
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:37,829
The reason was not you.

224
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,030
It wasn't your fault.

225
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,150
He will face severe punishment.

226
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:47,270
Thank you.

227
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:07,174
(Jiang Honghai was the true culprit)

228

(Jiang Honghai confessed to all crimes
and was sentenced to life imprisonment,)

230
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,808

The old case is now cleared.)

Liu.

236
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,790
Coming.

237
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,869
Give me a hand.

238
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,749
Lei,

239
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,790
you're back.

240
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,310
You guys done eating?

241
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,109
Yes.

242
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:38,150
Alright.

243
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,349
Take care now.

244
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:39,949
Bye.

245
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,070
Take care.

Shan,

248
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,829
lend a hand.

249
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,869
Shan, give us a hand here.

250
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:49,670
Lei, you're back.

251
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,270
Gao.

252
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,229
Haven't seen you here in ages.

253
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:56,070
That's true.

254
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:57,270
Sit down.

255
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:57,829
Okay.

256
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:58,749
Alright. Go ahead.

257
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:00,070
- Enjoy your food.
- Okay.

258
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:00,629
We will.

259
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,240
Bye.

260

Haisheng,

261
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,470
pulling overtime again?

262
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,270
Lei, you're back.

263
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,349
Why'd you buy so much salt again?

264
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:13,030
- We still have some.
- It was on sale.

265
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,550
Why is it so crowded today?

266
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,149
Yang from Propaganda retired.

267
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:19,230
It's a goodbye dinner.

268
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:21,950
That explains the crowd.

269
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,750
Jing.

270
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,750
Jing, pork chop noodles for me.

271
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:29,149
Coming right up.

272
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:29,790
Okay. Thanks.

273
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,669
Coming right up.

274
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,030
You have pork chop noodles now?

275
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,750
With your belly? Forget about it.

276
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,550
Then I'll go keep Yang company.

277
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,270
Go ahead.

278
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,149
Yang,

279
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,149
you're retiring.

280
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,310
Why come to the canteen

281
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,510
instead of eating out?

282
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,310
Ever since your wife

283
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,869
took over this designated canteen,

284
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,589
the food's been tastier
than any restaurant.

285
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,109
- Thanks.
- All done?

286
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,510
Jing, we're finished.

287
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,710
Back to the station.

288
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,470
Okay.

289
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,349
Go ahead.

290
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:01,230
Thanks, Jing.

291
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,829
Take care.

292
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:02,424
Okay.

293
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:03,189
Let's go.

294
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,349
Stay put.

295
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:10,270
Don't move around, got it?

296
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:18,310
Chang, how's the homework going?

297
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:19,550
Not bad.

298
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,310
Your handwriting keeps getting better.

299
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,030
Have some water.

300
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:30,389
Jing.

301
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:31,550
You're here, He.

302
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,389
Sorry to bother you.

303
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:33,750
It's okay. Chang got straight

304
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,629
to his homework.

305
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:35,349
Really?

306
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,149
Your mother-in-law?

307
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,030
Did she get admitted?

308
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,030
Don't even ask.

309
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,589
Did you say thank you to Ms. Jing?

310
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,688
Thank you, Ms. Jing.

311
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:42,669
You're welcome.

312
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:43,950
We'll head off now.

313
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,790
Say goodbye.

314
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,030
- Bye, Ms. Jing.
- Bye.

315
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,750
- Bye.
- Take care.

- You look busy.

320
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,429
Take a seat.

Shan, two fried noodles, please.

322
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:01,470
Coming.

323
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,629
Don't move it.

324
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,589
It's too heavy. Let me do it.

325
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,189
It's fine.

326
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:10,349
Be careful.

327
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:12,950
Shan,

328
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,389
two fried noodles here.

329
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,270
Right away.

331
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:01,829
Jing,

332
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:03,349
is my soup ready?

333
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,230
Been ready.

334
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,070
I'll get it for you, Ziwu.

335
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:08,270
Are you eating here

336
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,270
or taking it to go?

337
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,829
To go.

338
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:10,710
Okay.

339
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:17,750
Here.

340
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,349

341
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:19,230
Smells great.

Got it.

347
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:27,950
- Right away.
- Go ahead.

348
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,600
Let me.

349
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,950
Alright, you two find a seat then.

350
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,589

351
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:43,990

Your father took his evening meds.

358
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:21,950
I didn't give him

359
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,950
the supplements.

360
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,550
He finished

361
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,750
all the supplements

362
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,829
you put in the pill box.

363
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:28,629
Those bottles are colorful

364
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:29,710
with foreign writing.

365
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,710
Couldn't read it.
So I didn't touch them.

366
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,510
I'll handle it.

367
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:33,310
Okay.

368
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,950
I need to tell you,

369
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:38,230
your father had another episode
this afternoon.

370
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:41,149
After his nap,

371
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,349
he was watching TV just fine,

372
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,669
and then he suddenly said

373
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,149
he wanted to call

374
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,750
some old colleagues from way back.

375
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,950
I didn't dare stop him.

376
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,829
He even got out

377
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,950
the phone book.

378
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,152
Luckily, they were landline numbers.

379
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:58,109
Probably those old colleagues

380
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,629
don't use landlines anymore.

381
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,829
He didn't get through.

382
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,990
I just wanted to let you know.

383
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,550
Okay.

384
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,829
I'm leaving now.

385
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:06,070
Okay, take care.

Right away.

409
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,270
You shouldn't have brought
your wife here.

410
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,990
We can't let loose.

411
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,070
I thought we were here
for business today.

412
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,189
Huo, famous across the Southwest,

413
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:57,750
is actually henpecked?

414
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:59,189
If this gets out,

415
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:02,270
no one in our circle will believe it.

416
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,389
And from what I know,

417
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,829
your wife should be

418
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,950
the young lady
of the Nanbang family, right?

419
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,790
Was that on purpose?

420
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,349
Don't bring up my ex-wife again.

421
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,990
Right, ex-wife.

422
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,189
So you lost your wife's family backing

423
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:32,070
and couldn't operate there anymore?

424
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,470
That's why you want to move
into the Wannan market?

425
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,109
The crackdowns over there
Have gotten stricter these years.

426
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:42,149
Business is tough.

427
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,109
Plus, the market for the old goods
is shrinking.

428
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,869

Huo, your reputation
has always been well-known.

432
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,950
But this is our first time
working together after all.

433

Caution is the parent of safety.

434
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,429
We have our own principles.

435
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,429
Business is business.

436
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,669
Flesh

437
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:50,790
is something we don't touch.

438
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:57,310
So, you won't give me any face?

439
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,629
I don't care about your rules.

440
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,629
This is Wannan.

If you want to get things done here,

442
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,869
you must play by our rules.

443
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,869
You're not cops, are you?

444
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,829
Old-timer,

445
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:36,030
you've watched too many movies.

446
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,589
What era is this?

447
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:42,710
You'll be ousted like this.

448
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:44,510
Not touching flesh

449
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:46,950
doesn't make us cops, right?

450
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,470
Truly sharp-tongued.

451
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:52,990
You make it sound like
I'm pushing you too hard.

452
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,669
Since you won't give me any face,

453
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:59,030
then there's no point
in working together.

454
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:05,790
Sister-in-law,

455
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:08,589
you make things complicated.

456
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,470
What's wrong with using it?

457
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,750
I'll use.

458
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,109
What did you just call me?

459
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,109
Sister-in-law.

460
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:53,950
What's our rule?

461
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:59,270
We don't touch flesh.

462
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,230
Look at you.

463
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:03,589
You've never quit, have you?

464
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,790
Breaking the rule knowingly.

465
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,109
Want out?

466
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,470
But they were too arrogant.

467
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:27,310
My apologies

468
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,429
for the drama.

469
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,829
Since Mr. Bao doesn't want to cooperate,

470
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:34,030
then

471
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,629
we'll take our leave.

472
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,950
Don't touch me.

473
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,030
We smashed up your place twice in a row.

474
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,790
My apologies.

475
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,710
Call Gui.

476
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:33,656
(I miss you so much at Solo)

477
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:37,990
You're here.

478
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,629
Thanks.

479
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,550
Have a seat.

480
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:42,269
Why treat me again?

481
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:43,669
You really don't have to.

482
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:46,070
I looked for the person
you asked me to find.

483
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,269
At least within Yunxi City,

484
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:48,990
I couldn't find any trace of her.

485
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,990
Okay, thanks.

486
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:55,709
Then, please just keep an eye out
for me whenever you can.

487
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:56,536

Who is Chen Yumo to you,

489
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,070
that you'd go this far?

490
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,629
Someone very important to me.

491
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:06,430
Let's eat.

492
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,269
Waiter, order please.

493
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,589
Huo and Qing, you're here.

494
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,229
Our boss

495
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:40,870
has arranged this place for you.

496
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,350
For the time being,

497
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,870
you can stay here peacefully.

498
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,269
Here are the keys.

499
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,030
If you need anything,

500
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,589
just tell me. I'm Qiang.

501
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,109
Don't stand on ceremony at all.

502
00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:58,470
The decorations here

503
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,669
aren't antiques
or cultural relics, are they?

504
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,390
Coming from a small town,

505
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,709
we tend to be a bit clumsy.

506
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,950
We can't risk breaking
anything we can't afford.

507
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:10,950
Qing, you're joking.

508
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:13,470
With the goods you possess,

509
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:15,269
you could buy anything.

510
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:19,470
But we need the channels to cash them.

511
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:22,749
That's exactly why we came
to find your boss' boss

512

for cooperation.

513
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,629
Don't worry about that.

514
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:28,870
The place might be a bit old,

515
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,390

with Bao Hei's side.

There are cut marks
on the victim's neck.

564

He bled out.

565
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:35,189
Given the bloodstains
and blood volume at the scene,

566
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,070
the carotid artery was likely lacerated.

567
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,109
Rigor mortis is complete.
