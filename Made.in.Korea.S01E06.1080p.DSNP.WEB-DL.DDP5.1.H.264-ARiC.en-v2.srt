1
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,226
Therefore, in order
to heighten society's vigilance

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,438
against the dangers
of narcotics addiction,

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,148
the Prosecution seeks
the sentence of death.

00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>Ten years in these robes…</i>

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>…and I've learned one thing.</i>

6
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,405
I pledge…

7
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,489
I pledge…

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,242
…before the proud Taegeukgi…

9
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,578
…before the proud Taegeukgi…

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,789
- …to devote…
- …to devote…

11
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,709
…my loyalty to the President…

12
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,420
…my loyalty to the President…

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,884
…and the everlasting glory
of our homeland.

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>Just because we wear the
same clothes and stand in the same place</i>

15
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>doesn't mean we walk the same path.</i>

16
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,269
MILITARY POLICE

17
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,906
<i>Some pledge their hearts</i>

18
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,575
<i>to the nation.</i>

19
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,994
<i>Some</i>

20
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,954
<i>rise in its defense.</i>

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,586
<i>And some</i>

22
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,214
<i>betray it to its fall.</i>

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,093
Ah, I got it.

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>Baek Kitae knew
exactly what kind of path</i>

25
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,056
<i>he was choosing for himself.</i>

26
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,435
<i>And what kind of bloodshed
it would demand.</i>

27
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:48,066
<i>There's only one reason
men like him cry patriotism.</i>

28
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,361
<i>To line their own pockets</i>

29
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,279
<i>with the nation's name.</i>

30
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,657
<i>For me,</i>

31
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,245
<i>patriotism means fighting those bastards
to the bitter end.</i>

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,389
Geonyoung.

33
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,850
Geonyoung!

34
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,396
Geonyoung!

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,109
Geonyoung!

36
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,030
Hyeeun.

37
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,868
- Hyeeun!
- Geonyoung…

38
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,036
Hyeeun!

39
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,287
Geonyoung.

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,371
Hyeeun!

41
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,165
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,209
Oh… Geonyoung!

43
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,752
So…

44
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,672
Are you awake now?

45
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,925
Baek Kitae,
you son of a bitch!

46
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,262
Why did you tail
Director Hwang that day?

47
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,641
Did you kill him with Kang Daeil's help?

48
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,108
Hey!

49
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,361
What the hell are you up to, you bastard?

50
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,528
Ms. Jang Hyeeun.

51
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,114
You know Kim Minsu, right?

52
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,199
Your guitar instructor.

53
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,368
Under orders from the North,

54
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,579
he recruited factory girls
and formed an underground organization.

55
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,667
And the operation funds
he got from the North?

56
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,047
You, Ms. Jang Hyeeun,
were the one managing them.

57
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,092
You son of a bitch!
What the hell are you talking about?

58
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,929
It was just money we pooled
for club activities…

59
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,145
Then,
I'm guessing your brother knew

60
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,731
that you're a commie.

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,068
Prosecutor Jang over there

62
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,862
leaked internal information
on Kim Minsu's case,

63
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,824
- and you passed it on to him, right?
- No, that never happened!

64
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,951
No, Geonyoung did nothing wrong!

65
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,035
Does that mean…

66
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,914
you did do something?

67
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,750
Hyeeun! Hyeeun, it's okay!

68
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,919
Hyeeun, it's okay. Stay calm!

69
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,796
- You are…
- Trust me!

70
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,507
…deeply involved with Kim Minsu.

71
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,134
Right?

72
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,807
- Hyeeun!
- The thing is…

73
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,434
Hyeeun! Don't say anything!

74
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,645
Hyeeun! No! Don't say anything!

75
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,940
Hyeeun! Don't fall for that!

76
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,569
Hyeeun, it's okay!

77
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,530
<i>I, Kim Minsu, received
operation funds from the North</i>

78
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,615
- …<i>and ran an underground organization</i>…
- No!

79
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,617
- …<i>with Jang Hyeeun.</i>
- Hyeeun, look at me!

80
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,369
- Look at me! Trust me!
<i>- Through her</i>…

81
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,830
…<i>older brother, Jang Geonyoung,</i>
<i>she passed me intel…</i>

82
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,832
Baek Kitae,
you bastard! Come here!

83
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,959
Come here! Talk to me!

84
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,252
Talk to me, you bastard!

85
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,046
You came after me…

86
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,008
without being ready for this?

87
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,439
This fight won't end
until one of us is dead.

88
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,027
And it sure won't be me.

89
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,199
Mr. Jang.

90
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,328
Can you see clearly now?

91
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,961
EPISODE 6: MADE IN KOREA

92
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,720
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

93
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,606
- What happened?
- Yesterday, Prosecutor Jang's sister

94
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,110
was arrested by the KCIA
for violating the Anti-Communist Law.

95
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,862
Looks like they're trying
to drag Jang into it.

96
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,741
Those cocky little bastards have
no sense of decency…

97
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,160
How dare they go after a prosecutor?

98
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,122
Do they think
the prosecution sits under them?

99
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,959
This could shake the entire organization,
so we need to respond right away, sir.

100
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:02,505
We'll lodge an official protest
and find a way to pull Jang out.

101
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,427
What about that thing
you brought Chief Na last time?

102
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,345
It seemed like he was pleased with it.

103
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,597
We're in for an all-out war.

104
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,682
Brace yourselves.

105
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,933
Yes, sir.

106
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,190
So, how did your meeting go
with the President?

107
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,068
Well,
CEO Kim of Seongwan Constructions

108
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,987
got his nomination,

109
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,323
and Taejong Group was given
a little more time.

110
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,741
Congratulations, Chief.

111
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,327
Chief Cheon won't be too happy
when he hears about this.

112
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,787
What's he going to do?

113
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,123
This is what the President wants.
What can we do?

114
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,666
Chief.

115
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,045
What's going on?

116
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,216
We just got an urgent call
from the Prosecutors' Office.

117
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,219
It seems like the KCIA grabbed
one of their prosecutors.

118
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,395
CHIEF OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
SECURITY SERVICE, CHEON SEOKJUNG

119
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,068
Chief Na, what brings you here?

120
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,363
You tell me.

121
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,783
I didn't want to get involved,

122
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,703
but I just heard something outrageous.

123
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,791
You know the entire Prosecutors' Office is
in an uproar right now, right?

124
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,170
Not really.

125
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,424
Did something happen?

126
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,225
Look, everyone knows
the KCIA is in your hands,

127
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,268
but don't make it so obvious.

128
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,064
The President always stresses

129
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,275
that we should each stay
in our lane and do our jobs.

130
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,409
Meaning there are lines
we shouldn't cross.

131
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,042
You say that, but you seem to be…

132
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,714
paying a lot more attention
to the prosecution these days.

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,143
With the election coming up,
the President has a lot on his mind.

134
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,276
Let's not take things too far

135
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,821
and just focus on what each of us
is supposed to do.

136
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,617
That's all I'm saying.

137
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,622
I'm sorry, sir.

138
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,084
If I'd known about it,
I would've let you know right away.

139
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,796
But Baek went rogue on this,
and I couldn't…

140
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,006
So you're saying…

141
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,760
Baek Kitae arrested a prosecutor

142
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,555
without my permission?

143
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,681
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

144
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,267
But things are not looking too bad.

145
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,646
We've got a solid case against the sister,
so even if the prosecution pushes back,

146
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,857
- <i>it won't be easy to get out of--</i>
- Hey.

147
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,191
Yes, sir?

148
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,735
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Yes, sir.

149
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,070
<i>Have you no control over Baek?</i>

150
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,283
<i>Do you or not?</i>

151
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,454
I do, sir. I have control over him.

152
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,165
- Do your job right.
<i>- Yes, sir. I'll do it right.</i>

153
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,541
Do it right.

154
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,751
<i>Yes, sir. I will…</i>

155
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,419
<i>I'll do it right.</i>

156
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,343
WRITTEN STATEMENT

157
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,552
As you can see,

158
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,764
Kim Minsu sold your sister out
to save his own skin.

159
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,975
If what he wrote there is true,

160
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,520
your sister could face
the death penalty for espionage.

161
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,609
Using a public security case…

162
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,155
to screw me over?

163
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,075
And dragging my sister into it too?

164
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,744
Mr. Baek Kitae.

165
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,331
You think I'll just accept…

166
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,669
- these statements in court?
- Doesn't matter if you accept them or not.

167
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,714
If we push it through,
it'll hold enough weight in court.

168
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,383
Come on, you know this already.

169
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,974
If you want to save your sister, sign it.

170
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,268
When you're given a chance, you take it.

171
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,020
You don't want your only sibling

172
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,898
to end up like your father, do you?

173
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,410
Come on, outside.

174
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,578
It's important.

175
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,423
- Hey.
- What is it?

176
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:01,011
I got chewed out
for pulling shit without reporting in.

177
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,932
Orders are, let Jang go right away…

178
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,976
…and focus on the Japan deal.

179
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,728
I'll take care of it.

180
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,521
Take care of it how exactly?

181
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,274
You know the election's
right around the corner.

182
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,652
The amount of funds we secure now
will decide the game.

183
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,988
That's exactly why I'm doing this.

184
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,075
I need to deal with Jang for good
to focus on the deal--

185
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,786
It looks like the prosecutors
got Chief Na on their side.

186
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,123
The higher-ups already agreed
to take Jang out of play,

187
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,083
so you just stick to business.

188
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,628
You know that…

189
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,299
Chief Cheon never repeats himself, right?

190
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,636
I've delivered his message then.

191
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,311
Next time, run it by me first, will you?

192
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,981
Not cool.

193
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,009
Come on out.

194
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,100
Hold still. Hey, hang on.

195
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,645
Mr. Jang.

196
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,522
The other day,

197
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
you asked me if I trusted Baek Kitae.

198
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,320
I thought about it,

199
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,533
and there's no reason
you and I can't get along.

200
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,207
You son of a bitch.

201
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,960
From now on, let's get along.

202
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,420
You get what I'm saying?

203
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,798
I'll be in touch.

204
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,385
Hey!

205
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,387
Where's Hyeeun?

206
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,681
She's fine. Don't worry.

207
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,121
Mr. Jang!

208
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,921
Oh! What the heck…

209
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,090
Everything okay while I was gone?

210
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,551
Pack your stuff.

211
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,678
We're clearing out

212
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,848
and heading back to the office.

213
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,725
What are you talking about, sir?

214
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,769
No more secret investigations.

215
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,354
Mr. Jang.

216
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,940
Did something happen to you?

217
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,611
We've got plenty of work piled up
at the office.

218
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,074
From now on, we stick to our duty.

219
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,295
<i>What happened with Prosecutor Jang?</i>

220
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,464
<i>We don't need to worry about him anymore?</i>

221
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,592
He won't be able
to make a move anytime soon.

222
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,136
<i>Hmm… All right.</i>

223
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,430
<i>Anyway, make sure
you deliver the goods on time.</i>

224
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,682
<i>My father's not as forgiving as I am.</i>

225
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,975
I keep my promises.

226
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,228
What about the raw materials?

227
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,066
<i>We can scale up production
as much as we want.</i>

228
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,817
<i>The problem is securing the source.</i>

229
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,988
Breaking into the Taiwan supply line
isn't easy, either.

230
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,076
<i>That's actually why I called.</i>

231
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,161
<i>To hit the volume I set,</i>

232
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,206
<i>securing a stable supply comes first.</i>

233
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,625
Can you go overseas with me next week?

234
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,545
There's someone we need to meet in Saigon.

235
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,470
SAIGON, VIETNAM

236
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,306
Why aren't they moving?

237
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,937
Geez, what are they doing?

238
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,235
The mango juice here is amazing.

239
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,611
Hold on a second.

240
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,908
Excuse me.

241
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,493
Two cups of mango juice, please.

242
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,922
Oh, here you go.

243
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,679
Did you hear the news?

244
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,806
There was a big mess
in Nha Trang a few days ago.

245
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,349
What happened?

246
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,309
Apparently, inspectors came from back home

247
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,145
and turned the whole unit upside down.

248
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,858
You know Captain Yoon, the one who got
caught skimming supplies with US soldiers?

249
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,943
He's been ordered back home.

250
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,404
How do you even know all this?

251
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,073
Come on. I've been out here
for over two years.

252
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,160
I could call the Viet Cong
my brothers at this point.

253
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,057
Lieutenant!

254
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,767
Sir.

255
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,144
The company commander is asking for you.

256
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,771
Someone's come from Seoul.

257
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,856
From Seoul? Who?

258
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,649
PERSONAL RECORD
NAME: BAEK KIHYUN

259
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,819
Korea Military Academy, Class 26.
Top of your class.

260
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,280
Born in Japan,

261
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,240
both parents deceased…

262
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,201
HEAD OF SECURITY COMMAND
MAJOR WON DONGHYEOK

263
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,453
- Your brother's with the KCIA?
- Yes, sir.

264
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,917
Man, it's hot, huh?

265
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,631
The temperature's lower than in Seoul,

266
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,008
but it's the damn humidity
that drives you crazy.

267
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,344
Is it always like this here?

268
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
It's worse now during monsoon season.

269
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,016
Listen.

270
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,936
Do you know why I came
all the way from Seoul?

271
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,107
What about why I called you in?

272
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,067
I'm not sure, sir.

273
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,779
You were questioned
by Nam Sanguk before, right?

274
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,825
- Did he say anything about me?
- Not that I recall, sir.

275
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,161
Yeah?
Guess you two aren't that close.

276
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,875
Well, that prick was always stuck-up,
coming from a fancy family.

277
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,460
Good thing we shipped him off.

278
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,131
What, you didn't know?

279
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,134
That jerk got kicked out
of Security Command.

280
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,721
Anyway, you look like
you've been through some shit.

281
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,683
Probably got more sense than he does.

282
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,770
Though we'll have to see
if you measure up to your big brother.

283
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,606
I'm sorry, but I don't follow.

284
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,660
I'm saying I've got a job for you.

285
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,663
What? You don't want to get promoted?

286
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,998
That's not it, sir.

287
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,084
Everyone who comes out here's
only got promotion on their mind, right?

288
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,837
Isn't that why you're out here
slaving away?

289
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,797
You'll start tomorrow.

290
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,257
I'll clear a desk for you.

291
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,552
Get your bearings for a few days,
then you'll serve under Colonel Chu.

292
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,723
You know Chu Gwangseop,
commander of the 29th Infantry Regiment?

293
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,516
Yes, I do, sir.

294
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,477
Go under him
and report every damn thing he does,

295
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,938
without leaving out a single detail.

296
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,233
Do this right,
and Nam Sanguk's former post…

297
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,362
will be yours.

298
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,004
This is Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung,
the one I mentioned before.

299
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,381
Come on, pour him a drink.

300
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm Jang Geonyoung.

301
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,143
Let me pour you a drink, Chief Na.

302
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,542
Even after all you've been through,
your spirit hasn't broken.

303
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,965
Mr. Jang, you're a true patriot, huh?
They're hard to come by.

304
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,717
If you support the prosecution, sir,

305
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,719
I'll bring clear proof

306
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,807
that Chief Cheon Seokjung
is backing Baek Kitae.

307
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,770
Rush in too soon,
and it'll backfire on you like last time.

308
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,275
There's one thing I learned
during my recent detention at the KCIA.

309
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,361
The evidence to bring down
Chief Cheon will come

310
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,738
straight from Baek Kitae himself.

311
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,490
How would you make that happen?

312
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,659
First, we'll put Baek in custody…

313
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,412
…and drive a wedge between the two.

314
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,375
Cheon's the kind of guy who'll cut off
his tail first when things blow up.

315
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,003
And Baek knows that well.

316
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,046
He'll do whatever he can

317
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,840
to save his own skin.

318
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,218
Like an internal conflict?

319
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,262
If you give me a chance…

320
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,640
I'll get him no matter what.

321
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,767
You may lower your head,

322
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,062
but you're not the sort
to ever bow to anyone.

323
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,356
If you're looking
for a blade against Cheon,

324
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,983
he's not a bad choice, sir.

325
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,299
Hey, you came.

326
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,641
What do you want? Why'd you ask to see me?

327
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,894
I just want to get closer to you.

328
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,938
Thinking of jumping ship?

329
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,405
Well, I get it. At this rate,
Baek Kitae will push you aside

330
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,949
and take Hwang's place.

331
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,867
Not you, Mr. Pyo.

332
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,996
You're right.

333
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,499
Let's be honest with each other.

334
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,381
Lately, the President seems
to be pushing Chief Cheon away.

335
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,174
Best to go with the flow, right?

336
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,971
How was your dinner with Chief Na?

337
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,142
So you're interested in him as well, huh?

338
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,644
How did you know about that?

339
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,980
Work in the KCIA for over a decade,

340
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,898
and you know everything.

341
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,195
What can I do for you?

342
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,995
When Baek Kitae handed money
over to Cheon,

343
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,331
you think that's all he did?

344
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,916
Or what?

345
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,210
Baek Kitae has

346
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,422
a recording of Cheon.

347
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,633
Bring it to me.

348
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,636
If you do,

349
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,638
it'll be you…

350
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,018
who takes Hwang's seat.

351
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,020
Not Baek Kitae.

352
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,732
So?

353
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,775
How does that sound?

354
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,652
Sounds good.

355
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,450
CHEON SEOKJUNG

356
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,364
Where did you say
you were going? Saigon?

357
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,491
Yeah.

358
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,826
For how long?

359
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,870
Not long.

360
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,373
Just keep an eye on Jang Geonyoung for me.

361
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,167
If anything happens, call me right away.

362
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,252
Got it.

363
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,879
Hey, can I bum a smoke?

364
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,801
You want to live till you're old and gray.
Why start again?

365
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,763
Maybe because life's looking up.

366
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,015
Got the craving back.

367
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,559
I knew you wouldn't last forever.

368
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,688
The lighter.

369
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,315
- You can have the rest of the pack.
- Thanks, man.

370
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,144
Security Command?
So, what's the big deal?

371
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,478
Goddamn bastards.

372
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,606
I could just…

373
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,150
Fucking hell.

374
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,360
Hey, let's go.

375
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,619
Let's go, kid.

376
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,455
Hey!

377
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,415
What the hell are you doing?

378
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,211
Sir.

379
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,963
Look at this clown.

380
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,885
Major Lee from the Anti-Communist Bureau
recommended you?

381
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,679
- Yes, sir.
- That's impressive, kid.

382
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,058
You won over someone as strict as he is.

383
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,560
Not at all, sir.
It's an honor to serve under you.

384
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,941
<i>Colonel Chu Gwangseop.
Korea Military Academy, Class 11.</i>

385
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,818
<i>Born in Hapcheon, South Gyeongsang-do.</i>

386
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,154
- Now, get the hell in.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,739
<i>He earned
the President's trust</i>

388
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,532
<i>when he was with
the Capital Garrison Command,</i>

389
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,077
<i>and was the first of his class
to get promoted.</i>

390
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,745
<i>He never cared for combat,</i>

391
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,331
<i>and spent his days
entertaining guests and partying.</i>

392
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,875
<i>Sneaking out supplies was
just routine for him.</i>

393
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,086
<i>The man's got quite the reputation.</i>

394
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,465
<i>But this time,
it's on a whole different scale.</i>

395
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,261
<i>There are some Vietnamese officers
colluding with local arms traffickers,</i>

396
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,057
<i>and we have intel that Chu's been
in frequent contact with them lately.</i>

397
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,211
There he is.

398
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,922
Soon to be our partner
who'll save us, Jason Chang.

399
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,883
He's Taiwanese-American,
and has a firm grip on the smuggling route

400
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,969
for raw materials used
to make Taiwanese meth.

401
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,347
He's been busy pushing heroin here
in Saigon the last few years, though.

402
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,102
I'm glad you got in touch.

403
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,688
I didn't think you'd fly
all the way to Saigon.

404
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,023
As I mentioned on the call,

405
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,693
I have a partner
I really want to introduce you to.

406
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,406
Mr. Baek is in need of a large quantity
of raw materials.

407
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,992
I told him you might be able to help.

408
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,204
Well, I've never done business
with Koreans before.

409
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,751
I don't want to waste my time
on a rookie and take a risk.

410
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,294
It's just as I expected.

411
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,671
He's worried because you're a rookie.

412
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,301
Saigon has changed a lot.

413
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,722
American soldiers are openly doing drugs.

414
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,767
No wonder they lost the war.

415
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,560
Were you in Vietnam?

416
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,813
I was in the jungle in '65.

417
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,609
Back then, the Americans had
some sense of justice.

418
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,780
A lot of us died fighting
the Viet Cong in the jungle.

419
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,658
We, the Americans, the Viet Cong.

420
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,374
You must have made a lot of money, huh?

421
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,046
The war is coming to an end now.

422
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,840
Aren't you gonna make some money?

423
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,551
See for yourself.

424
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,679
You'll think differently when you see it.

425
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,203
Sir!

426
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,039
At ease.

427
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,292
Wait here.

428
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,377
Yes, sir.

429
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,051
<i>Second floor, last room down the hall.</i>

430
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,180
<i>Colonel Chu's meeting
a Vietnamese officer there today.</i>

431
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,801
Okay. So?

432
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,929
Can you handle it
smoothly this time again?

433
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,100
If you're smooth,
I'm smooth too.

434
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,701
The items I deliver are all top-notch.

435
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,952
You know that, right?

436
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,582
What the Viet Cong wants
is not Korean weapons.

437
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,711
<i>They need the M16 or heavy machine guns
the Americans use.</i>

438
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,339
<i>That's also possible.</i>

439
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,344
<i>There are a few things we've skimmed
from the American soldiers.</i>

440
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,804
<i>Good.</i>

441
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,560
Come in.

442
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,699
Show me what you've got.

443
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,472
Ever seen a rookie make
something like this?

444
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,475
A 100% purity.

445
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,519
What a beauty.

446
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,731
Deal?

447
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,651
Deal.

448
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,708
<i>If I arrest Baek Kitae,</i>

449
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,711
your sister goes to prison,

450
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,546
and you, Mr. Baek Kihyun,

451
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,757
might be forced out of the army too.

452
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,261
It was really good.

453
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,967
Are you all right?

454
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,572
What are you doing here?

455
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,078
- Hey, let's go!
- What happened to your face?

456
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,756
Hey, Baek! Let's go, kid!

457
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,716
What the hell are you doing?

458
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,221
Out of the way!

459
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,565
<i>President Park
is scheduled to hold a campaign rally</i>

460
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,192
<i>in Busan tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.</i>

461
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:15,363
<i>Large crowds are expected to gather
at the venue from early morning.</i>

462
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,199
<i>After the rally, President Park will…</i>

463
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,743
When the President comes
to Busan tomorrow,

464
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,162
Chief Cheon Seokjung
will accompany him, right?

465
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,164
I guess so.

466
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,126
And that's our chance.

467
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,295
While Cheon's out of Seoul,

468
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,465
that's when we strike.

469
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,358
- Soyeong! Soyeong!
- Oh, Daeil!

470
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,444
You don't have an umbrella? It's pouring!

471
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,821
Did you bring what I asked for?

472
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,906
Yeah.

473
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,286
I was worried Kitae might find out,
so I couldn't sneak out much. Sorry.

474
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,165
If he finds out the stuff's hitting
Busan streets, he won't sit still.

475
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,750
You sure about this?

476
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,669
I'll figure out a way to get the money.
Just wait a little.

477
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,505
Don't worry about it anymore.
This is all I need.

478
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,216
How can I not worry?

479
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,302
Neither you nor Kitae will tell me
what's going on--

480
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,845
I said, don't worry about it!

481
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,389
I'll…

482
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,559
I'll see you later.

483
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,562
Daeil.

484
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,112
Sunyeong.

485
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,290
- Daeil!
- Hold still!

486
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,668
No!

487
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,505
Daeil!

488
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,674
Don't make this hard!

489
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,220
Daeil!

490
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,472
- Baek Soyeong!
- Let go!

491
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,976
No! Stop that!

492
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,145
Let go of me! Let go!

493
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,109
Kang Daeil.

494
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,028
Hey, Kang Daeil!

495
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,323
Damn it, you idiot!

496
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,616
Hey, did you just dodge?

497
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,785
You dodged? Huh?

498
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,621
Are you just stupid?

499
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,623
Or you think I'm a goddamn joke?

500
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,793
You had the fucking nerve to screw me over

501
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,753
and still show up to see Baek Soyeong?

502
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,845
Well…

503
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,809
you can't do anything now anyway, right?

504
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,854
The Narcotics Unit's been shut down.

505
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,107
It's all over, isn't it?

506
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,775
You asshole.

507
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,738
You'll rot in prison, you son of a bitch.

508
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,117
I told you there's only one way for you
to get out of this alive, didn't I?

509
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,038
You don't know what you're talking about.

510
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,831
If I betray Kitae…

511
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,835
I'm dead for real.

512
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,297
Yeah, that's why… Baek Kitae, damn it.

513
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,133
That's why you should put him
behind bars with your own hands!

514
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,010
Hey! Kang Daeil!

515
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,680
Listen carefully
if you want your sentence reduced.

516
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,059
Confess to everything.
Say Baek Kitae made you do it.

517
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,353
Got it? You understand?

518
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,358
What the hell are you looking at?

519
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
This bastard.

520
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,584
Let me see, damn it.

521
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,342
You've been toying with meth,
and now you've turned into a damn junkie.

522
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,264
How many times do I have to ask?

523
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,017
You've been keeping Baek Kitae's ledgers.

524
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,310
Where are they?

525
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,687
I have no idea what you're talking about.

526
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,023
You know

527
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,027
my brother's a public official.

528
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,112
Oh, yeah?

529
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,155
Then what about the meth here?

530
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,616
Are you saying you got this on your own?

531
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,871
Are you seriously going to take
all the blame?

532
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,084
Why would you do that for a guy
who dragged his own sister into his mess

533
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,752
and turned her into a criminal?

534
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,381
Can I have a cigarette, please?

535
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,725
Thanks.

536
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,990
Sunyeong… Oh, right.

537
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,535
Ms. Oh Yejin.

538
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,622
You told me you had older brothers.

539
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,499
Was that true?

540
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,043
I only have two younger siblings.

541
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,254
Well then,

542
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,298
you should know.

543
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,968
You see,

544
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,263
I feel sorry for my big brother.

545
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,309
Our parents died young,

546
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,521
and he had to feed us, clothe us,
and put us through school.

547
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,276
Do you have any idea how hard he worked?

548
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,529
And now…

549
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,703
…you're telling me to sell him out
just to save myself?

550
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,207
No, I'd rather die.

551
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,261
How did it go?

552
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,138
Baek Soyeong didn't even bat an eye.

553
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,308
She'd jump straight into hellfire
if he told her to.

554
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,810
Well, good thing we got
at least one of them to talk.

555
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,064
- What do you mean?
- Kang Daeil confessed.

556
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,191
Are you serious?

557
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,651
Yeah.

558
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,322
<i>It was all…</i>

559
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,160
<i>Kitae. He made me do it.</i>

560
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,998
<i>Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.</i>

561
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,463
<i>He said we should really expand
the meth business.</i>

562
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,590
<i>The Ikeda clan…</i>

563
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,220
<i>When Manjae was alive…</i>

564
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,392
Soyeong doesn't know any of this.

565
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,103
I just asked her

566
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,940
to bring it to me, and she did.

567
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,441
That's all, I swear.

568
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,651
Mr. Jang.

569
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,903
Soyeong really doesn't know
anything, okay?

570
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,531
Promise me. She doesn't know anything.

571
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,741
She has nothing to do with this!

572
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,036
- Daeil. Daeil, I hear you.
- She doesn't know anything.

573
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,539
I need you to promise me. Promise me.

574
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,623
All right.

575
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,376
I hear you, so calm down.

576
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,213
You're doing great, okay? Just trust me.

577
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,383
Okay.

578
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,011
You're going to say the whole thing again

579
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,971
from start to finish.

580
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,307
Slowly and clearly.

581
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,602
Ready, go.

582
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,938
It was all…

583
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,986
Kitae. He made me do it.

584
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,782
Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.

585
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,039
He said we should really expand
the meth business.

586
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,837
Who the hell are you? Gangsters?

587
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,921
Excuse me.

588
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:56,425
Esteemed KCIA agents,
the Busan District Prosecutors' Office

589
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,595
requests your cooperation
in carrying out our official duties.

590
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,807
"Search and seizure warrant"?

591
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,773
Well, screw you.

592
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,399
Yeah, well, that's the plan.

593
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,485
Push through!

594
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,783
Go! Go! Go!

595
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,124
Get in there! Go!

596
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,251
Don't let them push you back! Go!

597
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,420
Go!

598
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,178
Open the door!

599
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,817
You don't point a gun
at a fellow public servant!

600
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,449
Goddamn it!

601
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,745
What the fuck's going on?

602
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,122
Fucking hell!

603
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,333
What a mess!

604
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,063
Who are you?

605
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,775
Who are you?

606
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,945
Mr. Baek Kitae!

607
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,706
Come with us.

608
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,917
What do you think you're doing?

609
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,002
Serving the country.

610
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,047
I'm serving the country too.

611
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,762
ARREST WARRANT

612
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,639
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

613
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,813
All right, let's go.

614
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,024
- Make way, please.
- Clear the way.

615
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,108
Come on.

616
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,028
- Coming through.
- Step aside, please.

617
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,700
My fellow citizens of Busan.

618
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:32,790
Thanks to your support
in the 5th and 6th presidential elections,

619
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,877
I was elected president twice.

620
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,176
Chief,

621
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,638
the prosecutors have arrested
Baek from the KCIA.

622
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,142
I have always been grateful
for that support.

623
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,728
We just got word.

624
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,272
They've raided Chief Cheon's office too.

625
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,276
Tell them to strike hard.
No hesitation, no half measures.

626
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,946
This is our chance

627
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,076
to wipe out all those KCIA men
in the Blue House.

628
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,329
And I…

629
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,345
Step outside for a minute.

630
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,264
- Pardon?
- Go have a smoke.

631
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,488
<i>It was all…</i>

632
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,411
<i>Kitae. He made me do it.</i>

633
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,165
<i>Baek Kitae's the one who suggested it.</i>

634
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,254
<i>He said we should really expand
the meth business.</i>

635
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,339
<i>There's this yakuza clan</i>

636
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,134
<i>Manjae tried to deal with</i>

637
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,678
<i>back when he was alive.</i>

638
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,222
<i>Baek Kitae…</i>

639
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,936
<i>and that woman named Ikeda Yuji…</i>

640
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,815
<i>made a deal…</i>

641
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:29,698
Daeil seemed to care a lot
about Baek Soyeong.

642
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,743
Turns out the bastard's a romantic.

643
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,579
Thanks to that, everything went smoothly.

644
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,669
All right, Mr. Kang Daeil.

645
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:49,009
Write down everything
you've told us about Baek Kitae so far.

646
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,719
Don't leave out a single thing.

647
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,812
This is the meth

648
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,440
Baek Soyeong was distributing.

649
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,317
With Kang Daeil.

650
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,569
It's a massive amount,

651
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,571
and we caught it.

652
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,787
Baek Soyeong and Kang Daeil

653
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,040
were skimming off meth

654
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,709
behind your back.

655
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,298
You get the picture now?

656
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,009
If you lock me up,

657
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,305
you think you're going
to move up in the world?

658
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,933
What are you doing this for?

659
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,978
I want to get rid of people like you

660
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,897
from this world.

661
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,400
You want to change the world?

662
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,236
That kind of thing?

663
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,489
Even if I'm gone,
the world isn't going to change.

664
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,497
When you handed the money to Chief Cheon,

665
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,417
you got that on tape, didn't you?

666
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
That tape.

667
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,218
Hand it over to me.

668
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,804
Otherwise, you're going to prison.

669
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,514
Both you

670
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,599
and your sister.

671
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,943
You think Cheon's
going to protect you? Hmm?

672
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,416
I'll handle it and ensure it never causes
you any trouble, Mr. President.

673
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,730
What happened?

674
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,650
Baek Kitae's being questioned
at the prosecutors' office,

675
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,611
but things are not looking good, sir.

676
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,615
What about Pyo?

677
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,784
I can't reach him.

678
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,875
To him, you're just a tool
he can toss aside anytime he wants.

679
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,922
You know that better than anyone.

680
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,305
Where's the tape you recorded of him?

681
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,226
If there was such a thing,
you'd already have it.

682
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,895
You guys have already torn through

683
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,065
my house and my office.

684
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,614
Mr. Baek.

685
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,160
Do you trust Pyo Haksu?

686
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,381
DEPARTMENT HEAD, BAEK KITAE

687
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,798
CHEON SEOKJUNG

688
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,051
Should be interesting.

689
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,386
I wonder what'll happen

690
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,723
if Cheon finds out you made

691
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,184
a recording of him.

692
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,397
Mr. Baek, you've come this far.

693
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,859
Let's see it through.

694
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,759
Have you heard of the Cu Chi tunnels?

695
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:45,639
They're underground tunnels the Viet Cong
dug to take cover from US bombing.

696
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,936
They're barely big enough
for one person to squeeze through.

697
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,730
It was hard even to breathe in there.

698
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,942
What are you talking about?

699
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,819
Just let me finish my story.
It's not that long.

700
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,781
I've never told this to anyone before.

701
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:07,827
I'm sharing it only with you, Mr. Jang.

702
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,379
<i>My company was sent in with orders
to root out the Viet Cong hideouts.</i>

703
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,174
<i>Those tunnels were like a maze.</i>

704
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,678
<i>Hard to see ahead,</i>

705
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,347
<i>never knowing where a bullet
might come from.</i>

706
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:34,396
<i>Fear closes in, and the only thing
you can rely on is your comrades.</i>

707
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,483
<i>All you can do is follow them forward.</i>

708
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,545
Commander,
we've got a radio message.

709
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,215
<i>What's the situation?</i>

710
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,175
It is a Viet Cong hideout, sir.

711
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,720
<i>Continue the search
and report back as you go.</i>

712
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,638
Colonel.

713
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,931
Colonel!

714
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,977
Sir, we've confirmed
it's a Viet Cong hideout.

715
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,520
We should pull out.

716
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,317
<i>The guys wanted to pull out,</i>

717
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,403
but I couldn't do that.

718
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,238
Why?

719
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,366
Because I was a soldier,

720
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,743
and soldiers follow orders.

721
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,539
I led my guys deeper

722
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,584
into hell.

723
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,144
<i>Boom.</i>

724
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,690
Boom.

725
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,819
Boom.

726
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,616
Boom.

727
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,250
It was US bombing.

728
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,754
The moment they confirmed
it was a Viet Cong hideout,

729
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,089
they started the bombing.

730
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,885
Whether we lived or died
didn't matter to them.

731
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,806
After all,

732
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,227
I was just cannon fodder
for someone else's rise.

733
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,855
By sheer luck,

734
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:45,276
I barely made it out
of those tunnels alive.

735
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,281
I went straight to the battalion commander
to punch him in the face.

736
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,119
I really wanted to kill that bastard.

737
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,247
But guess what?

738
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,875
I took responsibility
for my men's deaths and stepped down,

739
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,754
while that bastard jumped two ranks

740
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,089
and pinned on a star.

741
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,428
Whether you buy it or take it at gunpoint,

742
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,222
I believe

743
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,475
it's those with power
who change the world in the end.

744
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,895
You can keep shouting about justice.

745
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,939
But without power,

746
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,317
you're just treated like cattle.

747
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,660
WRITTEN STATEMENT

748
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,257
<i>So what?</i>

749
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,177
The world's gone mad…

750
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,639
so you're just going to sell meth
and make money?

751
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,063
Don't be ridiculous, asshole.

752
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,566
Your pathetic excuse disgusts me.

753
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,656
Everyone makes their own choices in life.

754
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,118
And you chose

755
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,454
to be a drug dealer

756
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,831
and a killer.

757
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,671
You know the biggest difference
between you and me?

758
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,511
I have the power
to take responsibility for my choices.

759
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,000
Also, I think you're mistaken.

760
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,422
Chief Cheon won't really care
whether that tape exists or not.

761
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,968
All that matters to him is
whether something benefits him or not.

762
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,929
Because he has power.

763
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,684
Drag it out all you want,

764
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,436
but that tape

765
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,523
will end up in my hands.

766
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,900
I guess you still have faith in people.

767
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,238
Pyo Haksu.

768
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,032
Do you trust him?

769
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,459
Let's drink, shall we?

770
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,962
Wow, congratulations.

771
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,679
Chief.

772
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,182
This election is an important one.

773
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,209
You should
listen to it yourself, sir.

774
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,218
CHEON SEOKJUNG

775
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,404
<i>Look, I'm genuinely curious.</i>

776
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,866
Why do you work so hard?

777
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,037
Is it because of your father?

778
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,539
I heard he was a junkie.

779
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,208
He even killed your mom.

780
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,346
You'll never win against me.

781
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,472
Why, you ask?

782
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:28,643
Because you're one of those foolish cattle
who think they can change the world!

783
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,889
<i>I've received your gesture of goodwill.</i>

784
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,391
<i>Quite a sum, I must say.</i>

785
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:13,020
<i>No one appreciates my efforts
like you do, Chairman Park.</i>

786
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,066
<i>And please tell
Chairman Kim of Taejong Group</i>

787
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,527
<i>that he has nothing to worry about.</i>

788
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,532
How dare you bug me?

789
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,076
What the hell are you trying to pull?

790
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,162
Chairman Park of Seongwan Constructions,

791
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,455
Chairman Kim of Taejong Group.

792
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,835
The President was paying extra attention
to them ahead of the election, no?

793
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,962
You've got guts, I'll give you that.

794
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,548
You think
he'll believe anything you say?

795
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,384
You're already finished.

796
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,598
The raid today

797
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:53,186
was all signed off
by the President himself, too.

798
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,906
Chief Na, you still don't know
the man, do you?

799
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:11,037
The President doesn't have much affection
for his dogs like you or me.

800
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,707
As long as you don't touch his food,

801
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,835
it doesn't matter
if you're a shepherd or a mutt.

802
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,173
Just wag your tail and you're fine.

803
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,550
But…

804
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,015
You, Chief Na?

805
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,854
You went and laid your hands
right on his food.

806
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,735
I wonder how many more tapes like that
are sitting in the KCIA.

807
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,237
You son of a bitch!

808
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,159
Hey, man.

809
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,161
You're fucked.

810
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,259
Damn it.

811
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,637
You bastard!

812
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,704
Did you think I wouldn't know

813
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,248
what you'd try to pull

814
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,251
while I was gone?

815
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,965
Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung met
with Chief of Staff Na Yongcheol.

816
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,676
He also met with Pyo Haksu.

817
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,514
Looks like Pyo has switched over to Jang.

818
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,599
And now,

819
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,268
Jang's looking for Kang Daeil.

820
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,690
That little shit.

821
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,818
You get the picture now?

822
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,780
What the…

823
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:11,741
Hey, call an ambulance!

824
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,910
Hey, come on! Call an ambulance!

825
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,621
- Somebody, call an ambulance! Now!
- Ambulance!

826
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,043
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

827
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,015
Damn it!

828
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,791
I'm going to survive on my own,

829
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,252
not get used and tossed out like you.

830
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:20,977
Baek Kitae.

831
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,812
Baek Kitae, come here.

832
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,648
Come here, you bastard.

833
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,527
Who the hell are you? Huh?

834
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:35,908
Baek Kitae!

835
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:38,953
Prosecutor Jang Geonyoung.

836
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,414
You're under arrest

837
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:43,791
for bribery.

838
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,793
What?

839
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:46,961
Goodness…

840
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,385
Hey!

841
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,121
When did you find out

842
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,290
I'd switched over to Jang Geonyoung?

843
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,169
If Cheon Seokjung finds out

844
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,671
you switched over to him,
what do you think he'll say?

845
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,090
Is that a threat or what?

846
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,180
You sly bastard.

847
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,434
You used me as bait
to bring Jang Geonyoung down?

848
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,481
Hey, Pyo.

849
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,317
Get your act together now.

850
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,154
Stop going back and forth between sides.

851
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,617
You're confusing people. All right?

852
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:11,337
PROSECUTION SERVICE

853
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,547
<i>That's right.</i>

854
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,176
<i>In the end, this is what Baek Kitae chose.</i>

855
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:23,099
<i>But those who pull the trigger</i>

856

<i>and investigating their connections,</i>

859
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:35,361

860

861
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,325
<i>Authorities launched a full investigation
into those implicated.</i>

862
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:43,452
<i>The ringleader, identified as Kang,</i>

<i>In a note left behind,</i>

867

<i>and what follows falls to the living.</i>

870
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,570
Hello, Chief Na.

871
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,073
Get rid of Jang.

872
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,950
If the blade's broken, you throw it out.

873
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,910
<i>Yes, sir. Understood.</i>

874
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,434
PROSECUTOR JANG GEONYOUNG

875
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,360
Where's Jang Hyeeun?

876
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:13,250
Where's Jang Hyeeun?

877
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,044
Shut up and put your head on the ground!

878
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,339
JANG MYEONGHO

879

INTERROGATION ROOM 1

880
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,298
Here he comes!

881
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,260
Mr. Jang,
are you being taken into custody?

882
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,679
Since when have you
been colluding with the drug ring?

883
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:09,807
<i>To those in power,</i>

884
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,351
<i>the people are still nothing but cattle,</i>

885
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:16,188
<i>and I, who lived differently
from them, am gone.</i>

886
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,943
<i>I wonder.</i>

887
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,280
<i>What was my patriotism truly for?</i>

888
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,303
We closed Director Hwang's murder case

889
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:49,847
with Kang Daeil
as the sole culprit as well.

890
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,810
You're a lucky man, Baek.

891
01:11:56,186 --> 01:12:00,441
The guy who worked for you
took all the blame with him to the grave.

892
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,905
Sniffing out money isn't your only skill.
You can use your head too.

893
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,826
It was all thanks to your help, sir.

894
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,374
You got one on me too?

895
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:21,962
The tape.

896
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:24,965
No, of course not.

897
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,968
How could you even say that?

898
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,185
Baek.

899
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,607
We're really in the same boat now.

900
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:45,986
Let's do this right.

901
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,147
We're all set.

902
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,028
All right, go ahead!

903
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,163
Good work, guys.

904
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,734
Cheers.

905
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,946
- Cheers.
- Cheers!
