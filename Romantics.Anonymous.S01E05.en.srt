1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,041
You didn't have to run away,

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,541
Hiro.

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,708
You forgot this. Here!

4
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,333
Your bamboo sword is the one I like.

5
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,500
I really love it!

6
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,583
Lee Hana! What were you thinking?

7
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,500
-Huh?
-You scared me!

8
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:49,791
Sorry.

9
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,458
I went to kendo practice this morning.

10
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,083
Good morning.

11
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,875
-M-Morning.
-Good morning.

12
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,458
Oh, do you have any plans
after work today?

13
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:11,416
Wataru wants to grab drinks with us
at Brush before the holidays.

14
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,916
I'll make sure
he doesn't try to make you sing.

15
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,458
At Brush, huh?

16
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,375
Yeah.

17
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,541
I'm not feeling so good today.

18
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,083
Sorry.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,833
Huh?

20
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,833
Good morning.

21
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,083
-Morning.
-Good morning.

22
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,750
-Newbie, wipe down the tables.
-Okay!

23
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:24,208
SPÉCIAL ORANGETTE

24
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,833
Um, excuse me.

25
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:36,833
Yes?

26
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,000
This chocolate…

27
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,416
Is there something wrong
with the chocolate?

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,416
No, nothing's wrong.

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,833
It's delicious.

30
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,083
It's delicious, but…

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,833
It's not the taste I remember.

32
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,041
I see.

33
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,875
What do you think is different?

34
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,625
The recipe's changed
since 30 years ago, right?

35
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:08,208
Would it be possible to make
a few orangettes like the old ones?

36
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,000
Huh?

37
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:14,500
At my age, it's not unusual
to have a fainting spell.

38
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,416
It's nothing to make a big fuss about.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,875
Haven't you been working late
again recently?

40
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,083
Well, the company won't run itself.

41
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,791
You shouldn't take
orthostatic dizziness lightly.

42
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,541
A sudden loss of consciousness

43
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,666
happens when blood flow
to the brain drops.

44
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,250
But it could be heart-related.

45
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,458
Either way,

46
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,583
I recommend you undergo
a full medical checkup.

47
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,416
Chairman Fujiwara told me not to tell you.

48
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,291
How is he now?

49
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,291
Still being tested.

50
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,541
Are you sure I don't need to come?

51
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,041
Please pretend you don't know.

52
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,291
He probably doesn't want you to worry.

53
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,291
He's so stubborn.

54
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:12,458
He'd go that far to protect his pride,
even from his only son?

55
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,916
Fine.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,375
It's reassuring to know you're with him.

57
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,625
Let me know the results.

58
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,541
I will.

59
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,125
Oh.

60
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,291
He's still being tested,
but I think he'll be fine.

61
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,958
Why isn't Sosuke here at a time like this?

62
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:41,250
Honestly, it's a comfort
having you by the chairman's side.

63
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,583
It'd be too late if something happened.

64
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,208
We need to start thinking
about a successor.

65
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,958
No need to worry.

66
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,708
We have another Fujiwara right here.

67
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,250
Since you're his twin brother's son,
you're practically his own son.

68
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,041
Isn't that right?

69
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,083
Please don't say that.

70
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,916
You're being dramatic.

71
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,750
What do you mean
by "saving someone with chocolate"?

72
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,041
My parents were strict when I was a child.

73
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:19,708
They wouldn't let me eat chocolate,
saying it was bad for my teeth and health.

74
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,833
But my older sister saved her allowance

75
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,500
and bought orangettes for me after school.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,916
That secret taste we shared,
just the two of us, was so delicious.

77
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,791
And now…

78
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,541
she's fighting an illness.

79
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,583
She's in the hospital.

80
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,916
I want her to taste that chocolate
from our childhood again.

81
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,291
Unfortunately,

82
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,041
a lot of time has passed.

83
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,333
If I can't buy them here,

84
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,125
I won't find them anywhere, right?

85
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,750
Time's running out for her.

86
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,416
I guess there's nothing I can do.

87
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,583
Thank you very much
for at least hearing me out.

88
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,500
Of course.

89
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,625
Excuse me.

90
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,041
Chief.

91
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,708
Is there any way to recreate

92
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:43,291
the old orangettes
that the customer was talking about?

93
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,125
For example…

94
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,625
Do we still have the old recipe?

95
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,291
Even if Chef Kenji left the recipe,

96
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,208
I don't know if I could recreate them.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,666
After all, I can't be sure of
how they tasted 30 years ago.

98
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,958
I might know.

99
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,875
Oh.

100
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,666
I used to love the orangettes
from this shop as a kid too.

101
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:23,875
It's true the current ones
taste a little different.

102
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,000
Um.

103
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,000
Even if there's no recipe,

104
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:38,166
are there records of chocolatiers
who worked here at the time?

105
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,833
Where were they?

106
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,666
Oh, somewhere around here.

107
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,083
Here.

108
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,083
Oh!

109
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,250
Twenty years…

110
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,500
Chocolatiers…

111
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,375
Ten years ago?

112
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,291
HEAD CHOCOLATIER

113
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,250
Oh!

114
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,916
-Maybe this person?
-Hm?

115
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,916
Oh, about 30 years ago?

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,958
RITSUKO SAEGUSA

117
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,916
Ms. Saegusa.

118
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,791
You've got a call.

119
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,041
Ms. Saegusa.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,500
You've got a phone call
from a place called Le Sauveur.

121
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,625
Give it to me.

122
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,291
Ritsuko Saegusa speaking.

123
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,166
Sorry to call you out of the blue.

124
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,583
I'm Sosuke Fujiwara,
the president of Le Sauveur.

125
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:42,291
Oh, I saw the news.
Kenji passed away, right?

126
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,333
Why do the handsome ones always go first?

127
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,166
So, what's this about?

128
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,666
Actually,

129
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,666
I'm calling about a recipe
from 30 years ago.

130
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:00,833
We have a customer
who needs that chocolate urgently.

131
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,416
How much time do you have?

132
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,500
Good evening.
I'm Fujiwara, the one who called you.

133
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,583
Sorry for making you come all this way.

134
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,000
I bet I look older
than you thought I would.

135
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,083
So, what kind of chocolate should I make?

136
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,875
Oh, my.

137
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,958
It's been a while.

138
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,791
Excuse me.

139
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,166
Yum.

140
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,541
Hmm.

141
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,125
You're right. Something's different.

142
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,833
I knew it.

143
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,291
What could be different?

144
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,166
Oh.

145
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,375
Wasanbon sugar from Awa.

146
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,541
We used Sanuki wasanbon back then.

147
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:42,125
Both are excellent,
but if I had to describe them…

148
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,416
Awa's has a bolder sweetness,

149
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,041
and Sanuki's is gentler.

150
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,541
Exactly.

151
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,791
Can we get Sanuki wasanbon?

152
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,333
Yes, but their shop's closed right now.

153
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,541
Do you still order from Sakaide Company?

154
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,750
Yes.

155
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,625
Get their president on the phone.

156
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,083
-Huh?
-Tell him it's Saegusa the chocolatier.

157
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh.

158
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,625
Understood.

159
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,041
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

160
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,958
Yes.

161
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,875
I'll put Ms. Saegusa on.

162
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,791
M-Ms. Saegusa?

163
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,250
No, no, no!

164
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,250
No need to put her on! Hello?

165
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,666
I can hear you.

166
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,291
M-Ms. Saegusa?

167
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,625
Bring Sanuki wasanbon to Le Sauveur. Now.

168
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,958
Or I'll spill that secret.

169
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,375
Your company will go under.

170
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,916
There you are.

171
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,083
Give me a break, Ms. Saegusa.
You never change!

172
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,166
You haven't aged a day.

173
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,916
I'm not into younger men.
Just drop it off and go.

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,708
What a greeting.

175
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,125
Thanks, as always!

176
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,083
Thank you!

177
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,375
All right, let's get to work.

178
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,166
I'll teach you,
so just follow my instructions.

179
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,875
Now, let's begin.

180
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,458
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,208
Thanks.

182
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,250
-You help too.
-Huh?

183
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,083
Can I?

184
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,166
Thank you!

185
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,875
She looks so happy.

186
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,708
Can I really do this?

187
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,541
-Of course.
-Really?

188
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,791
-Sure.
-Go ahead.

189
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,708
All right.

190
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,333
You got this.

191
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,875
Yeah, you can do it.

192
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,625
Nice job, Hana.

193
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,208
Really?

194
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,375
This smells amazing.

195
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,708
-Chief, isn't she a natural?
-She's good.

196
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,041
That makes me happy.

197
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,125
You don't squeeze it, huh?

198
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,375
Like this, right?

199
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,041
Try to keep it smooth, with no peaks.

200
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,250
Okay.

201
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,916
No!

202
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,583
Not like that. Like this.

203
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,458
-Sorry.
-Okay.

204
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,416
-Watch closely.
-Yes.

205
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:27,875
Ready?

206
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,500
Like this. See?

207
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,083
Like this.

208
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,041
Just like that. Got it?

209
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:40,750
Yes.

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,250
-Don't just stand there. Pay attention.
-Oh, yes. Sorry.

211
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,416
This position's crucial. See?

212
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,916
It can't be too low or too high.

213
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,375
Oh.

214
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,041
After you, Chef.

215
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,500
Chef? Call me Ritsuko.

216
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,291
Okay, Ritsuko.

217
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,625
Go ahead.

218
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,250
Should I add more ganache?

219
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,833
You just stand there and watch.

220
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,458
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,375
Sorry about that.

222
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,916
Does it taste different from back then?

223
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,708
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,333
After going through
all the trouble of making it…

225
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:56,166
Maybe it wasn't just the sugar.

226
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,083
I see.

227
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,125
It's different?

228
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,750
It might taste the same,

229
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,416
but perhaps it tastes different to me
now that I'm grown up.

230
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,083
Sorry this old lady couldn't help.

231
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,250
We're very sorry.

232
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,208
Is it okay if I stop here?

233
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,708
Yes, thank you.

234
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,583
Thank you for the ride back.

235
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,791
Not at all.

236
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,250
Thank you for traveling so far for us.

237
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,125
It was my pleasure.

238
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,583
I hadn't made chocolate in a long time.

239
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,291
It made me feel 20 years younger.

240
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,666
Funny, isn't it?

241
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,333
I'm a shriveled-up old lady,

242
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,958
but in my heart,
I'm still the same person I was back then.

243
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,625
Me too.

244
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,416
Thanks to the orangettes you made,

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,125
I felt like a kid again.

246
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,500
That's right.

247
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,250
I remember your father
used to come by often.

248
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,125
Even though he managed
a big confectionery company,

249
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:17,000
he'd always buy a ton,
saying he wanted his precious son

250
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,041
to have handmade chocolate.

251
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,750
You've grown into such a fine man.

252
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,083
I'm glad to see

253
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,750
Le Sauveur is still in good hands.

254
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,333
It's too bad.

255
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,083
I was hoping things would work out.

256
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:53,208
Still, isn't it great you've grown
into a fine man, Mr. Director?

257
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,375
That wasn't about me.

258
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,125
It was about my older brother, actually.

259
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:12,541
He was frail
and didn't have much of an appetite.

260
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:17,958
My father always bought him
his favorite orangettes.

261
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,208
He'd tell my brother
they were "energy balls."

262
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:29,291
As a kid, I was so jealous of that.

263
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:36,041
When I begged for some,
he'd scold me for being spoiled.

264
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,958
One day,

265
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,791
my brother secretly gave me
the chocolate he'd saved.

266
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,250
To me, back then,

267
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,500
it was the best thing I'd ever tasted.

268
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,875
That's why you worked so hard, didn't you?

269
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,041
You understood Reiko's feelings
better than anyone.

270
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,833
In my case…

271
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:21,250
I selfishly took away
my brother's favorite chocolate.

272
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,625
I was a clueless, lousy little brother.

273
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,916
Giving chocolate to someone

274
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,166
doesn't just make the other person happy.

275
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,708
It makes you happy too, doesn't it?

276
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm sure your brother was very happy

277
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,208
to see the smile on your face.

278
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,333
That's why

279
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,375
I think you were
a really good little brother.

280
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,250
You think so?

281
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,625
I do.

282
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,000
Wait a minute!

283
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,375
I just remembered.

284
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,333
I remember now.

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,833
The Spécial Orangette made just for kids.

286
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:19,083
There was a special recipe
that was created thanks to your father.

287
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,708
Oh, you're here.

288
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,375
Here, just like you asked.
They're ready to go.

289
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,125
Sorry to trouble you all the time.

290
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,708
My eldest son can only eat
chocolates from this shop.

291
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,166
Well, thanks to your idea,

292
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,583
we're thinking of selling
healthy chocolate for kids.

293
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,416
What do you think?

294
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,375
Here you go.

295
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,208
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

296
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,666
Yay!

297
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,958
Thanks.

298
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,958
Apparently, they used soy milk
instead of fresh cream.

299
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,208
Consuming the iron in soy milk
together with the vitamin C in oranges

300
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,291
is good for the body, it seems.

301
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,416
They used to make
special orangettes for kids.

302
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,541
Sorry to ask this,

303
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,041
but could you make them one more time?

304
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,500
-Of course!
-Of course!

305
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,083
Leave it to us.

306
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,041
All right.

307
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,250
Um…

308
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,000
Before your misunderstanding escalates,

309
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,000
there's something I need to tell you.

310
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,083
So, uh…

311
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:01,458
I didn't mean to listen on purpose, but…

312
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,625
Actually…

313
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,625
I was the one at the kendo dojo.

314
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Um…

315
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,750
It's a long story.

316
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,750
But anyway,

317
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,625
your love confession didn't actually fail.

318
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,958
Hiro's a really good guy.

319
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,375
So, you should try…

320
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,666
Hana?

321
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:43,750
Ha--

322
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,916
I told you, okay?

323
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,375
You just didn't hear
because you were asleep.

324
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,875
My heart was always trembling

325
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:27,000
If I see you smile

326
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:31,250
I'm afraid our relationship
Might become awkward

327
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,416
"CONFESSION"

328
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,458
I couldn't say anything

329
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:44,375
So I turned away,
Tears flowing down my face

330
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:48,208
I want to tell you how I feel

331
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,625
But when you're near

332
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,250
I can't say a word

333
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,875
I'm starting to hate that about myself

334
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,541
I need to be brave

335
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:01,791
So I won't have regrets

336
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:06,083
Little by little, I'll get closer to you

337
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,291
And I'll confess

338
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,875
That I love you

339
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:16,958
I can't say a word
I hate that about myself

340
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,708
I need to be brave

341
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:22,500
So I won't have regrets

342
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:27,333
Little by little, I'll get closer to you

343
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:32,625
And I'll confess

344
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,875
Here, try one.

345
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,375
It's delicious.

346
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,875
Tastes just like before.

347
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,750
No, even better.

348
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,666
Thank you.

349
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,625
I can't believe you bought these for me.

350
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,500
You've grown up, Reiko.

351
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:39,333
I've been a grown-up for a while.

352
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,666
I'm not a little girl
waiting for chocolate anymore.

353
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,750
Have one too.

354
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,708
It's so good.

355
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,625
I…

356
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:26,666
have this urge to steal.

357
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,541
But…

358
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,833
I…

359
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,625
I want to change!

360
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:40,541
I've found someone

361
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,833
I truly love.

362
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:49,166
So I want to be someone
I'm not ashamed of.

363
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,916
If I have flaws,

364
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,625
I'll swallow my pride
and try to fix them all.

365
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,250
Before my baby is born.

366
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I think I understand how you feel.

367
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,750
You have kleptomania too?

368
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,708
Huh? No, not that.

369
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,708
I meant

370
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,708
the feeling of wanting
to change for someone.

371
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,833
I think it takes courage to change.

372
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:28,125
And your courage
will definitely bring good change.

373
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,250
To change myself…

374
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:59,166
-Huh? F-From the hostess club…
-Is Yuri your favorite hostess?

375
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,000
Uh, I thought I'd lost these.

376
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,666
They were on the floor.

377
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,916
-Th-Thank you.
-I found them.

378
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,958
Doctor.

379
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,666
I'll start

380
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,666
by practicing giving back items
I found to their owners.

381
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,833
Oh, that's mine.

382
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:24,583
Oh! I found it on the floor.

383
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,250
Uh, thanks.

384
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,083
Hey, that's my glove.

385
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,625
-Huh?
-Oh?

386
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:31,708
When did you…

387
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:33,708
Found it there.

388
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,500
-There?
-Yes.

389
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:36,666
-Huh?
-Good for you.

390
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,666
Wow!

391
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,416
You won!

392
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:41,916
You ate it?

393
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,666
I ate it.

394
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,875
Just kidding. It was on the floor.

395
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,666
Lucky you. Score!

396
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,500
Y-Yeah, score.

397
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,791
Huh? W-Wait, how?

398
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,375
-Huh? That's mine!
-Oh…

399
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,375
What about me?

400
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,958
-Thank you!
-I'm happy for you.

401
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,666
-Yes.
-I'm so glad.

402
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,750
Here, Mr. Luxury Tuna.

403
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,083
If you'd like,

404
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,125
please keep it.

405
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,791
As thanks for your courage today.

406
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,166
Huh?

407
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,250
Thank you so much.

408
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,583
So, who made you want to change?

409
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,541
Was it Miracle Touch?

410
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,125
What are you talking about?

411
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,375
I told you, she likes someone else.

412
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:39,750
You're all flustered. So fishy!

413
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,958
Hey, buy me a drink,
and I'll listen to you as a friend.

414
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,625
I'll buy you a drink, so don't ask.

415
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,541
Fine. Where should we go?

416
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:56,416
Can I trust my friend
and drink until I drop for once?

417
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,541
I bet you always drink till you drop.

418
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,583
Pick a place.

419
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,250
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,791
He can't do kendo
without his bamboo sword.

421
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,250
Right? Yeah.

422
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,708
I'll just quietly drop it off.

423
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,500
We're here. Go on in. I'll park the car.

424
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,500
Got it. Thanks.

425
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:57,875
All right.

426
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,625
Huh?

427
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:12,666
Wait.

428
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,125
Hold on.

429
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,458
No, this is really a coincidence.

430
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:37,041
I came here by mistake.

431
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,750
A coincidence?

432
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,500
Yeah, exactly.

433
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,125
So it doesn't mean anything.

434
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,041
Okay, bye.

435
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:48,791
Your coat.

436
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,666
Do you mind taking it back?

437
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:57,500
So there won't be any more "coincidences."

438
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,250
I'll take it back.

439
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,583
Your coat's over there.

440
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,583
Are you mad?

441
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,500
At me?

442
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,750
You're acting different today.

443
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,875
What is this?

444
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,250
What do you mean?

445
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,000
Are you messing with me?

446
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,708
It's not like that.

447
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,958
Do you like me?

448
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,416
Or do you hate me?

449
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,500
It's not that I hate you.

450
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,791
So, you do like me?

451
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,125
Why would I try to sleep
with someone I don't like twice?

452
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,666
Does that mean you like me?

453
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,958
Don't mess with my head.

454
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,708
I've got my reasons too.

455
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,625
Bye.

456
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,333
I won't know…

457
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,708
unless you tell me.

458
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,791
What reasons?

459
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:01,666
I'll just set this down
and leave right away.

460
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,833
It'll be fine.

461
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,083
You don't need to see.

462
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,458
M-Mr. Fujiwara?

463
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,083
Just keep your eyes on me.

464
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,125
Like we practiced.

465
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,041
Huh?

466
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:39,208
What?

467
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,250
Doctor?

468
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:42,791
Doc…

469
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,125
Darth Vader.

470
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,250
Why are you here?

471
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,625
What are you doing, Doctor?

472
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:55,041
Well, uh… it's a long story.

473
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,666
Um, do you two know each other?

474
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,208
I'd ask the same about you two.

475
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:06,708
Don't tell me Darth Vader is…

476
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,500
Miracle Touch?

477
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,291
Oh?

478
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,416
What are you doing?

479
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,083
Hey.

480
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,166
That's right! She's Miracle Touch.

481
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,208
Let me introduce you.

482
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:34,375
She's the one I'm really into right now.

483
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,083
Huh?

484
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,875
