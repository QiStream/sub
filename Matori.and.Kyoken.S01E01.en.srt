1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,484
Gimme.

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,157
Enjoy.

3
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,326
Thanks.

4
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,897
What the hell!

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,491
Who is that? Is he okay?

6
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,742
He's out of it.

7
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,703
He's high out of his mind.

8
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,135
Hey!

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,805
Sir, you need to control yourself.

10
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,475
Hand over the cocaine.

11
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,561
Not unless you have the cash for it.

12
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,438
Just give it to me!

13
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,315
Quit it and get out!

14
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,399
Hey!

15
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,406
What are you doing?

16
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,355
Shut the hell up!

17
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,908
It hurts!

18
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,844
That's freaky.

19
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,470
Should we call the police?

20
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,930
Or an ambulance.

21
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,520
Damn amateur.

22
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,439
Learn some restraint.

23
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,524
WHERE IN ROPPONGI IS THIS?
THIS IS CRAZY

24
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,319
CAN'T BELIEVE WE CAN SEE THIS LIVE
THE COMMENTS WON'T STOP LOL

25
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,945
THIS CLUB WILL GET CLOSED DOWN

26
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,617
Stimulants, narcotics, cannabis.

27
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,162
People who have used these drugs

28
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,624
are now estimated
to total two million in Japan.

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,419
The number of people arrested
for drug-related offenses

30
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,838
is as many as 14,000 yearly.

31
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,477
Igarashi is the guy who got nabbed
for marijuana before, right?

32
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,688
And then cocaine and meth.

33
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,690
What a stereotypical scumbag.

34
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,235
It's horrible what he did to that woman.

35
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,071
I feel sorry for the bereaved families

36
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,074
when people like this kill someone
and get a light sentence

37
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,701
due to impaired mental capacity.

38
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,953
That's absolutely unacceptable!

39
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,246
Don't get mad at me.

40
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,749
That said, if that Mad Dog
finds out about this case,

41
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,960
things will get out of hand quickly.

42
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,213
Excuse me, which division are you from?

43
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,382
I'm not with the police.

44
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,636
Well, that's a problem.
Did no one stop you from coming in?

45
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,888
Only authorized personnel are--

46
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,558
I'm Kurosaki, a narcotics agent.

47
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,727
Excuse us, sir.

48
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:21,070
According to eyewitnesses, he collapsed
right after inhaling the cocaine.

49
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,740
So the drug caused his death.

50
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,824
What?

51
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,496
Why are you here?

52
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,457
To investigate, obviously.

53
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,043
The NCD can sit this one out.

54
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,587
Not as long as cocaine is involved.

55
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,422
This was a serial stabbing.

56
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,926
The perpetrator died due to an overdose,
so the police get jurisdiction.

57
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,180
You've got to cuff them
while they're still alive, you know.

58
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,808
Then get this over with quickly,

59
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,311
police mutt.

60
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,234
Get lost,

61
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,653
Ministry mutt.

62
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,461
Let the police handle this, dumbass.

63
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,966
Igarashi, you bastard!

64
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,720
Causing all this mess.

65
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,224
What if they start investigating us too?

66
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,767
Hey.

67
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,104
Oh, are you the Mr. Jellyfish
who contacted me?

68
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,063
Yes.

69
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,899
0.2 of speed, right?
First time offer. Let's go with ten.

70
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,359
Ten? You mean 10,000 yen?

71
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,574
You're a kid.

72
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,828
Are you an idiot?

73
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,830
Kids shouldn't be buying speed.

74
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
Listen up.

75
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,627
You try this just once
and there's no going back.

76
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,840
Your family, your friends…

77
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,300
You'll lose them all.

78
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,219
Why is a dealer lecturing me?

79
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,178
Shut it.

80
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,932
Go eat a hamburger, kid.
Then get fat and sleep!

81
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,729
Wait.

82
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,692
Crap, what am I doing?

83
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,701
Can't do math
'cause you never went to high school?

84
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,785
Piece of shit.

85
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,831
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,834
But two million per month is a bit much.

87
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,377
Don't speak.

88
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,421
Sorry.

89
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,465
I told you not to speak!

90
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,722
Come on now.

91
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,017
Enough with the overacting.

92
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:02,398
I guess you just can't forget
the good ol' acting days, huh?

93
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,943
You know what, fine.

94
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,654
I'll give you a scene to act.

95
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,909
Go on. Drink this.

96
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,037
What? But…

97
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,915
-That's…
-Ready?

98
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,833
Action.

99
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,253
Please let me off.

100
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,513
There.

101
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,723
Ready?

102
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,225
Action.

103
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,537
Good stuff, huh?

104
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,166
That's a good expression
for a washed-up former actor.

105
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,336
Let's get another angle next, yeah?

106
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,258
What's with those eyes?

107
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,179
Did you forget who gave
your debt-ridden ass some work?

108
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,514
It was me.

109
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,435
You've been knee-deep
in crime all this time.

110
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,106
Don't start thinking you can escape.

111
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,821
Two days!

112
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,907
Get me the rest of the money.

113
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,953
Go sell an eyeball or a kidney
if you have to!

114
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,957
What? You got a problem?

115
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,876
No, sir.

116
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,510
Hey, come out!

117
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,388
Quiet!

118
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,015
I'm here to collect.

119
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,142
Don't be so loud.

120
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,687
If you don't pay up,
I'm going to lose my damn organs!

121
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,230
-Get in.
-What?

122
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,315
Get in!

123
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,318
It stinks!

124
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,777
Keep this open!

125
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,820
-Stop!
-What?

126
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,905
God knows who's watching and from where.

127
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,159
Guys from all over
are trying to get me dead.

128
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,995
This again?

129
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,705
You're just being paranoid.

130
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,540
No.

131
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,920
Just the other day, there was a sniper
aiming for me from across the river.

132
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,882
You would be dead already
if that was true.

133
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,052
Why would a sniper go after
a homeless old man like you?

134
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
Don't change the topic.

135
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,847
I didn't.

136
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,892
Forget all that.

137
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,395
You did bring it, didn't you?

138
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,232
Here.

139
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,818
It's ice, not speed.

140
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,905
Ice, huh?

141
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,198
Hey!

142
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,492
Pay up for this month first.

143
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,788
What?

144
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,748
Hey, this is nowhere near enough.

145
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,583
Take any valuables.

146
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,793
What?

147
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,795
Like what?

148
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,671
Valuables?

149
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,475
Wait, you have a son?

150
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,481
That? Just throw it away for me.

151
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,573
Chiaki…

152
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,160
Takeru!

153
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,797
Can I even get anything for this?

154
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,722
Where's Kurosaki when we need him?

155
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,475
He hasn't checked in, as per usual.

156
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,061
-Screw that!
-Why are you yelling at me?

157
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,230
I know where Igarashi got the cocaine.

158
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,691
You went off on your own again?

159
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,860
You can't just be biting at everything.

160
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,653
That's why they call you Mad Dog!

161
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,489
He's just a stray dog with a sharp nose.

162
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,949
What's the address?

163
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,452
Room 203, Yuzuki Apartments,
3-Chome, Nerima City.

164
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,037
They're probably just cogs
in the machine, anyway.

165
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,749
Mr. Inaba, the cogs
will lead us to the machine.

166
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,959
What does that mean?

167
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,669
I shouldn't have to tell you,

168
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,047
but for our pride as the NCD,
don't let the police get ahead of us!

169
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,340
Yes, sir!

170
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,516
Mr. Kyonosuke, I finished 40 bags.

171
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,269
-Is that enough for the 0.1 net bags?
-Yes.

172
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,021
Make 20 bags of one gram gross next.

173
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,147
Okay.

174
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,816
Hey, hands off the merchandise!

175
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,776
Relax, I paid for it.

176
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,658
Want some?

177
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,328
I don't use it. I just sell it.

178
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,166
Hey, you! I told you to use water.

179
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,793
Yes, but that's kind of a pain.

180
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,172
If a customer gets busted,
they'll do DNA tests on that.

181
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,009
Can't we just use a courier service?

182
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,344
Use your brain.

183
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,639
Regular mail is harder to track down
compared to a courier.

184
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,681
You amateur!

185
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,685
What's up?

186
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,270
Hey. How did it go?

187
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,939
Yes, about that…

188
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,026
I tried to get in touch,
but there were cops there.

189
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,569
What?

190
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,820
I ran away.

191
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,073
Hang on now.

192
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,117
Did you check if the cops tailed you?

193
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,953
It's fine!

194
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,696
Wait, did that high schooler just…

195
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,406
Do we arrest him?

196
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,658
No, he's probably a regular student.

197
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,326
-Let him go.
-Let's go, then.

198
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,179
-Don't move!
-Hey, wait!

199
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,347
Stop right there!

200
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,144
Wait!

201
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,147
-Let me go!
-Watch out!

202
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,361
This is obstruction of official duties!

203
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,282
No! Help me!

204
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,285
Who do you think--

205
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,168
Regional Bureau of Health and Welfare,
Narcotics Control Department.

206
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,757
Wait, where's Mr. Kurosaki?

207
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,303
Hey.

208
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,224
You just left Yuzuki Apartments, right?

209
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,852
What? No, I didn't.

210
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,854
Put your hands on that wall.

211
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,523
Okay.

212
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,739
Shit!

213
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,831
Nimble and flashy moves, but too sloppy.

214
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,672
Is that it?

215
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,972
Screw you.

216
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,066
Shit!

217
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,736
All right.

218
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,863
Arrest me, then.

219
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,034
Ouch. What the hell, man?

220
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,007
Was it you who sold drugs
to Keiichi Igarashi, the rapper?

221
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,260
Hey, are police detectives
allowed to be this violent?

222
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,140
I'm not a police detective.
I'm a narcotics agent with the Ministry.

223
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,976
Narcotics agent?

224
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,106
Talk when you feel like it.

225
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,859
-About what?
-Don't talk if you don't want to.

226
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,193
About what, damn it!

227
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,195
Everything you know.

228
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,824
I've got nothing.

229
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,244
Too bad. Just one gram of meth
makes for a lethal dose.

230
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,081
Hey, what are you doing back there?

231
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,126
You're dead for sure
if I inject this into you.

232
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,421
As if you would.

233
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,881
That hurts!

234
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,799
Ouch.

235
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,217
Are you completely insane?!

236
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,302
Here goes.

237
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,763
Stop! Don't put that in my body!

238
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,015
Don't you sell this to your customers?

239
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,141
Wait, no.

240
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,435
You can't just kill a person.

241
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,021
No, I'm not going to kill anyone.

242
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:49,193
It's common for drug dealers
to die by overdosing on their own supply.

243
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,779
Don't move. You'll break the needle.

244
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,031
You're insane, you fucking psycho!

245
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,532
Yes, I'm insane.

246
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,703
I'll even become a "fucking psycho"
against people like you drug dealers.

247
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,830
You're bluffing.

248
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,290
No, I'm not.

249
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,795
Who's the one controlling your strings?

250
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,422
No idea.

251
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,258
Oh, yeah? Then die.

252
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,760
Okay, I'll talk!

253
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,886
I'll talk, damn it.

254
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,721
Who are you working for?

255
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,642
Guy named Matsubara.

256
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,478
There, I talked. Now, take out the needle.

257
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,771
-Take it out!
-Not yet.

258
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,439
Why? I already told you!

259
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,774
I'll give you a chance.

260
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,901
What?

261
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,903
I'll use your connection to Matsubara

262
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,073
and take down the drug cartel
connected to Igarashi.

263
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,783
I need you…

264
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,662
to become my "S."

265
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,664
"S"?

266
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,374
What's an S?

267
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,416
A spy.

268
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,044
What? Screw that. Why would I--

269
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,049
Die here as a junkie or live on as my S.

270
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,425
Decide right now.

271
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,512
Okay.

272
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,055
Okay, what?

273
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,934
I will…

274
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,645
become your S.

275
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,564
If you run, you'll be a wanted man.

276
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,276
I'll leak to the criminal underworld
that you were a spy.

277
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,736
They won't leave a traitor alive.

278
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,199
Without a place in either world,
you'll either die or go to prison.

279
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,662
Shit.

280
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,709
You're mad.

281
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,213
My enemies are mad.

282
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,382
No choice but to be mad in turn.

283
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,093
Ouch.

284
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,181
But…

285
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,767
What exactly do you want me to do?

286
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,104
You'll be my dog from today onwards.

287
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,943
This is Hibiki Kaga's
Resound! Info Catchman.

288
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,614
Next week, we'll take in the appeal
of the Mikami Ginza shopping district

289
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,907
and catch, catch!

290
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,076
I said "catch," but here I am punching.

291
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,454
See you next week.

292
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,707
And cut!

293
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,334
-Nice.
-Good work.

294
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,002
-Was that good?
-It was great.

295
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,712
Good. Looking sharp today.

296
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,088
-You think?
-Excuse me.

297
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,216
-Can I get a picture with you?
-Of course.

298
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,675
-Thank you.
-No problem.

299
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,511
Your face looks much smaller in person.

300
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,639
Really? I'm glad. Thanks.

301
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,557
-May I?
-Yes, of course.

302
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,101
Here goes. Say cheese.

303
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,772
-Okay! Thanks.
-Thank you.

304
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,441
-You a student?
-Yes, at a nearby girls' college.

305
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,151
Really? Neat.

306
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,654
Hey, I'm going to grab a bite.
Want to join me?

307
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,696
What?

308
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,449
Really?

309
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,617
-Absolutely.
-May I?

310
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,827
Of course. Where's my phone again…

311
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,579
Oh, I'll DM you.

312
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,414
-DM? Sure. Later, then.
-Okay.

313
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:54,127
The dealers we arrested all claim that
their leader fled the scene right before.

314
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,173
Maybe he disguised himself
as the high schooler you saw.

315
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,717
Kurosaki told us to let him be.

316
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,718
Kurosaki?

317
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,928
I did not.

318
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,930
Don't just tell a bald-faced lie!

319
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,599
You weren't on the scene
when we raided them, right?

320
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,017
-Kurosaki?
-I was there!

321
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,018
Stop lying!

322
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,019
Where were you?

323
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,188
Chasing the high schooler. But I lost him.

324
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,315
Oh, for heaven's sake.

325
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,401
Did the dealers give up their supplier?

326
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:23,156
No, they all say that their leader was
the only one in contact with the supplier.

327
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,700
Damn it.

328
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,577
If only you had caught that high schooler.

329
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,912
-I'll leave.
-We--

330
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,455
I'm still talking, Kurosaki!

331
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,501
That's… That's an "Ah!"

332
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,062
Sorry about that.

333
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,064
Not a problem.

334
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,734
I ate some sea urchin while you were gone.

335
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,527
It's fresh and delicious.

336
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,611
Really?

337
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,156
I'll have some, then.

338
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:22,049
Premium sea urchin
has a rather mature taste.

339
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,718
Maybe a bit too mature for me.

340
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,012
Does it taste too much of alum?

341
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,142
Here, have some.

342
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,644
-Come on.
-Wait a second.

343
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,108
Nice. Have some more.

344
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,886
I see she has cocaine
circulating in her body.

345
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,473
Should I give her some more?

346
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,495
Hey, Aoi?

347
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,207
Have a sip of this delicious water.

348
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,462
Meet Kaga and make him ingest cocaine.

349
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,547
Get it on video.

350
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,508
I'll get killed if they find out
I'm connected to you.

351
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,678
MPD, Narcotics and Firearms Division,
Akito Katsuragi.

352
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,429
Why am I getting arrested?

353
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,850
You're a dead man.

354
00:23:54,933 --> 00:24:00,856
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS,
GROUPS, OR CASES IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

355
