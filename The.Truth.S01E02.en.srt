00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:10,778
=The Truth=

2
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,136
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:19,472
You're all here.

4
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:21,432
Zhao.

5
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,033
You all look so beautiful today.

6
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:24,753
You too.

7
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:25,432
Exactly.

8
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:26,593
You flatter me.

9
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:27,712
Not at all.

10
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:29,673
You look incredibly cool in this outfit.

11
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,912
- That chain suits you.
- Little Zhao.

12
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:31,960
(Han Zhao, Ye Qian's childhood friend)
Look, Ye Qian's here.

13
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,313
Little Qian.

14
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:35,313
Don't call me that.

15
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:37,912
I've called you that since childhood.

16
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:38,873
What should I call you?

17
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:40,313
Baby Qian?

18
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,432
Nice bike.

19
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:44,920
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

20
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:46,233
I changed my mind.

21
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:48,873
Not coming, huh?

22
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:51,472
No one's coming?

23
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:52,472
Alright.

24
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:53,352
No one's coming?

25
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:54,953
You're having a blast, Liu.

26
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:56,632
Qing.

27
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:58,552
Got held up by something.

28
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,513
Sorry, I'm late.

29
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:01,192
Liu, have a seat.

30
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:02,233
Let's continue.

31
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,912
Really sorry about that.

32
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,393
Is your racing legal here?

33
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,393
All paperwork's in order.
Completely legal.

34
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,633
The police deal with illegality.

35
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,152
Well, after these three laps,

36
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:10,992
Little Qian will be at least fourth.

37
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:13,312
Don't believe me?

38
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,393
Let's bet.

39
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,992
Officers don't gamble.

40
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:23,513
How boring.

41
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:25,793
Just verbally, I know you're broke.

42
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:29,393
Okay, let's bet.

43
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:30,992
Qing, Liu.

44
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:32,752
This one's on me.

45
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:53,032
We'll fully compensate
for all damages here.

46
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:56,992
I also apologize to you all
on Liu's behalf.

47
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:01,793
However,

48
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,113
keeping us waiting this long?

49
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:07,913
Even for a first-time cooperation

50
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:09,513
with mutual distrust,

51
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,832
it's still too disrespectful.

52
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:16,233
In business,

53
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:18,113
rules matter most.

54
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,033
Better to lose the deal than lose trust.

55
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,432
Perhaps this trip

56
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:28,593
was a mistake for us.

57
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:30,312
Let's go, Liu.

58
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,392
Qing, wait.

59
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:37,312
We're very sincere
about this cooperation.

60
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,113
Excuse me.

61
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:43,113
Need to take this.

62
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,713
Overtaking on a bend?

63
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:06,392
It's too dangerous.

64
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:09,473
You don't know Little Qian at all.

65
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:27,673
Cool!

66
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:28,552
Awesome!

67
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:33,312
You two grew up together.

68
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:34,913
You must know him well.

69
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:35,992
Since you know him so well,

70
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,833
why haven't you won him over yet?

71
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:41,632
He told you that?

72
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,593
Isn't it obvious?

73
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:46,593
Ever since he moved into our dorm,

74
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:47,793
you've visited so many times.

75
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:49,793
Even the security guard
at the gate knows you.

76
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:54,752
And that ring you always wear.

77
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,432
It's made of plastic

78
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:57,992
with badly worn paint.

79
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:58,793
I think

80
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,552
he gave it to you
when you played house as kids.

81
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:04,552
Am I right?

82
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:16,752
You flaunt it in front of him daily,

83
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,992
yet he shows zero reaction.

84
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,153
Two possibilities.

85
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:21,872
First,

86
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:24,673
he's completely rejected you
in his heart.

87
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:25,713
Second,

88
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,233
he forgot about this ages ago.

89
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,464
Little Qian has always had someone
in his heart.

90
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:35,192
And it's not me.

91
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,872
I hear it's trendy now
for girls to pursue guys.

92
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:41,552
Why not try pursuing me instead?

93
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:42,713
For a change.

94
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:48,192
Get lost.

95
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:54,992
Okay.

96
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:58,312
Qing,

97
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:02,392
our boss, Xiang, wants a word with you.

98
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,392
When can we meet Mr. Bao?

99
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:29,392
What do you mean by 'the right time'?

100
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,512
Can you speak for Huo?

101
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:39,512
My words are Huo's words.

102
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:50,072
Qiang's side is all set.

103
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:52,273
I thought it would take more convincing.

104
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:54,793
Didn't expect that woman
to agree so readily.

105
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,593
This time, Huo sent his woman
to liaise with us.

106
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:04,113
Seems he's taking this cooperation
pretty seriously.

107
00:08:05,913 --> 00:08:07,312
What's the name of Huo's woman?

108
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:10,192
She is... Dan Qing.

109
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:11,512
Dan Qing?

110
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:18,200
Engrossed in painting, time flies.
[*"Dan Qing" means "Painting" in Chinese]

111
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:22,512
Wealth and fame
are fleeting clouds to me.

112
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:25,593
Good name.

113
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:00,553
You raced all night.

114
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:02,272
Why are you still so worked up?

115
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,032
Feeling down?

116
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,713
What's with the suspect?

117
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,313
I just don't get him.

118
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:10,632
He's seriously disturbed.

119
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:18,752
Do you really like her?

120
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:21,512
I do.

121
00:09:22,152 --> 00:09:23,473
Han Zhao is a good girl.

122
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,433
If you really like her,
pursue her properly.

123
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:29,392
So, won't you help me?

124
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:30,953
If you don't help me,

125
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:32,672
what if I fail?

126
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:47,152
Little Zhao told me you have

127
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:48,833
a longtime unrequited love.

128
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:49,953
Tell me about it.

129
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,632
Not your business.

130
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,152
When did you start smoking?

131
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,032
Give me one.

132
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:46,272
What are you here for?

133
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,032
What?

134
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:56,752
Your little dog bite
is more telling than the suspect's.

135
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,632
See? Teeth bite marks.

136
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:00,992
We've got a lead on our case.

137
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:06,872
Get back before your master sees you.

138
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:08,632
Lei,

139
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,473
I need the cigarette butt photos

140
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:11,473
to compare bite marks.

141
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:30,353
The bite marks on all cigarette butts
left at the crime scenes are very deep.

142
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,872
This reflects
the suspect's smoking habit.

143
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:36,152
He likely doesn't hold the cigarette
with his hand much while smoking.

144
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:38,473
Instead, he bites the cigarette
to take breaths.

145
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:39,473
I speculate

146
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:42,113
this habit is directly related
to the nature of his work.

147
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:45,752
Do you think it's possible
that some people have a habit

148
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:47,672
of biting down hard on the cigarette,

149
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,272
taking a couple of puffs,

150
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,672
and taking it with their hand?

151
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,512
That's possible.

152
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,593
But that would be a specific trait,

153
00:11:58,313 --> 00:11:59,113
rarely occurring.

154
00:11:59,113 --> 00:12:00,272
And if that were the case,

155
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:03,313
the bite marks should be
from the upper and lower incisors,

156
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,752
which are narrower.

157
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:09,032
But look at those photos.
They're all molar marks.

158
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:12,553
It's simple.

159
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:13,336
He...

160
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,912
Just...

161
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:15,713
Open wide.

162
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:17,872
See?

163
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:20,672
By biting the cigarette with his molars,

164
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,473
it doesn't interfere with work

165
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:25,193
or let the smoke sting his eyes.

166
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,888
The locations of these three cases

167
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:30,360
(Chen Xiaomeng, Weigang Street, Attempted Rape)
are Weigang Street,

168
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,568
(Li Ying, Tianpeng Street, Rape)
Tianpeng Street, and Huaibei Road.

169
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,353
(Guo Bingbing, Huaibei Road,
Rape and Murder)

170
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,632
They're across the city's east,
west, and north areas,

171
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:37,792
tens of kilometers apart.

172
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:39,912
The suspect is a mobile criminal.

173
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:41,872
The interval between crimes
is about 15 days.

174
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:46,512
Biting cigarette butts with molars
is common among heavy manual laborers.

175
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,953
A renovation worker
fits the suspect's profile perfectly.

176
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,313
And coincidentally,

177
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:55,833
all three scenes are surrounded
by renovation sites.

178
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:59,593
Combined with the suspect's
shabby clothing

179
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,632
(Yunxi City Map)
and poor economic status,

180
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,433
we can first hypothesize

181
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:05,912
that the suspect works at a nearby site.

182
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,113
His stint ends in around two weeks.

183
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,672
He chose these three locations

184
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:14,392
because he happened
to be working nearby.

185
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:18,392
The expensive cigarettes
were likely given by his employer.

186
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:21,752
And the cheap ones
must be his own purchase.

187
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,632
Following this reasoning,

188
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:27,313
there are quite a few trades
involved in renovation.

189
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:30,433
Carpenters, masons, painters,
electricians, and plumbers.

190
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:34,792
That's a lot of people to investigate.

191
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:39,833
We conducted
field investigations on this.

192
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,992
Plumbers and electricians
kick up a lot of dust while working.

193
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,752
They generally don't smoke on the job.

194
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,353
Nor do they smoke
by biting the cigarette butt.

195
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,553
Ruled out.

196
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,392
Painters wear masks when spraying paint

197
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,272
to prevent inhaling harmful fumes.

198
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,512
Ruled out.

199
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,593
Carpenters make up
a large portion of renovation work.

200
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:12,833
They work longer terms.

201
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,113
And wood dust is fine,

202
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,632
hard to clean off completely.

203
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:19,272
But no wood shavings
were found on any of the three victims.

204
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:20,833
Ruled out too.

205
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:36,313
Masons

206
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:38,473
require both hands for their work

207
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:40,193
and likely work short-term.

208
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:42,872
And they're exposed to a lot of dust.

209
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:46,512
This matches the victims' description
of the suspect's characteristics.

210
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:48,872
Ye Qian, here's what you do.

211
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:49,912
Notify everyone

212
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:52,672
to focus on all residences
around the crime scenes,

213
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:55,512
both completed renovations
and those currently underway,

214
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,272
to check the renovation crews.

215
00:14:58,152 --> 00:14:59,872
Prioritize investigating them

216
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:01,392
to find any leads.

217
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:02,152
Got it.

218
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:07,064
(Welcome
to Yehai Building Materials Mall)

219
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:22,360
(Buffet Restaurant)

220
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,408
(Meidu Concept
Decoration Engineering Co., Ltd.)

221
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:57,073
Chief Xu,

222
00:15:57,313 --> 00:16:00,152
there are two renovation companies
that fit the criteria.

223
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:02,433
Both are leading companies in the city.

224
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,553
Each has over a hundred employees.

225
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,872
If we DNA test everyone,

226
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,713
it could easily alert the suspect.

227
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:11,953
I suggest we investigate covertly

228
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,872
to avoid tipping him off.

229
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:17,713
As for suspects linked to the fishpond,

230
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,392
there are about sixty.

231
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,392
Any with prior records among them?

232
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:24,032
Yes.

233
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:25,992
Three have theft records.

234
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,713
Two with sexual assault records.

235
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:29,392
And they both

236
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:31,512
are masons.

237
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,313
One is Jiang Lianhong.

238
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:34,353
The other is Wang En'tai.

239
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:35,353
Wang En'tai

240
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:37,473
had a work injury a month ago.

241
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:39,032
His leg is in a cast.

242
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:40,032
He can be ruled out.

243
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:41,872
Have you located Jiang Lianhong?

244
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:42,953
We've sent people on it.

245
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:48,313
Ouch. It's me.

246
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,113
Qian.

247
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:50,472
Why are you here?

248
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:53,672
You don't know your own strength.

249
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,113
I shouldn't have come to you.

250
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:03,593
Got news?

251
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:04,593
No news.

252
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:14,113
I've been trying to find her

253
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:16,472
for almost ten years.

254
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:20,113
Maybe I was mistaken.

255
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:23,712
Won't know unless we try, right?

256
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:30,232
I have a friend

257
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:32,313
who works at this taxi company.

258
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:41,432
I've done you another big favor.

259
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:43,192
Next time you cook,

260
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,232
count me in?

261
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:46,753
Get lost.

262
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,113
A hobble for livestock.

263
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:52,232
I felt

264
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,113
I'd seen it somewhere before.

265
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:55,793
It took me a while to remember.

266
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:59,593
As a kid, I found something similar
in my hometown pigpen.

267
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:01,952
Chief Xu.

268
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:02,793
Chief Xu.

269
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:04,513
Proceed.

270
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:07,432
Most people
have never even seen this thing.

271
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:08,872
Let alone bought it.

272
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:12,313
Only manufacturers, vets,

273
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,113
or vet assistants would have access.

274
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,192
Little Qian and I

275
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:18,273
searched the whole city
to buy this thing.

276
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,273
Chief Xu, the ligature mark's photo.

277
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:27,513
A perfect match.

278
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:30,152
According to the seller,

279
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,833
snares of this pattern

280
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:35,672
were sold to two farms
in the city back then.

281
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:39,432
One is in the Taohua Village
in the west,

282
00:20:39,513 --> 00:20:42,432
and the other
is in Niulangang in the south.

283
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:45,553
Both farms have

284
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:46,872
more than 60 people.

285
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:47,912
We need to screen them all

286
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,073
to find the key lead.

287
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,033
Sure about these measurements?

288
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,353
No problem. Sofas are usually 900,

289
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:58,472
and coffee tables 600.

290
00:20:58,472 --> 00:20:59,712
They'll fit here fine.

291
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:01,872
Police.

292
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:04,113
Take the client to see other rooms.

293
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:05,232
Okay, come with me.

294
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:07,392
Where's Jiang Lianhong?

295
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,593
H-He left.

296
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:13,192
He left?

297
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:14,152
Yes.

298
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:17,392
Today was the last day
for the masonry work.

299
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,912
So he left after finishing.

300
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:21,593
I'm the manager.

301
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:23,793
You can talk to me.

302
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:24,472
Where did he go?

303
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,432
Can you reach him?

304
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,553
H-He probably went home.

305
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,392
Reach him now. Call him.

306
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,912
Alright.

307
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,513
Where did I put my bag?

308
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:38,513
I-I need to grab my phone.

309
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:03,472
Hello?

310
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,033
T-That's impossible.

311
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:11,432
Okay.

312
00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:13,152
I-I'll be right back.

313
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:27,753
Which brick is loose?

314
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,033
Which brick is loose?

315
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:32,353
They want to see you.

316
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,833
Jiang Lianhong, right?

317
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,392
Police. We have some questions for you.

318
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:50,672
W-What's this about?

319
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:54,033
What's that in your hand?

320
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,152
N-Nothing.

321
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:18,113
Why does the bag smell
so strongly of fish?

322
00:23:19,872 --> 00:23:20,872
I don't know.

323
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:27,353
Take him away.

324
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,113
I... Wait.

325
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:31,152
Brother.

326
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:31,833
Move.

327
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,073
Wait. Brother.

328
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:50,313
Name?

329
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:52,872
Jiang Lianhong.

330
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:53,753
Address?

331
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,313
Niulangang, South Suburbs.

332
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:58,192
Age?

333
00:23:58,952 --> 00:23:59,753
39.

334
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,073
Jiang Lianhong,

335
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:04,553
I have a few questions for you.

336
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:09,392
You only need to answer yes or no.

337
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,872
Starting last September,

338
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:21,192
you leased a fishpond in Group 3,
Xiaojiang Village, Niulangang, correct?

339
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:24,472
Answer yes or no.

340
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:28,993
Yes.

341
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,392
Over the past few years,

342
00:24:31,392 --> 00:24:35,712
you also assisted the local vet
in treating livestock, right?

343
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:36,833
Yeah.

344
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,593
And starting this March,

345
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:44,672
a villager helped you become a mason
at Meidu Concept Decoration Company?

346
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:47,152
Yes.

347
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,632
The cases on Weigang Street,
Tianpeng Street,

348
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:53,432
and Huaibei Road

349
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:55,152
were all your doing, right?

350
00:24:55,313 --> 00:24:56,113
No.

351
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:57,513
I didn't do it.

352
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:58,672
You've got the wrong person.

353
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:00,232
If you didn't do it, why did you run?

354
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:03,753
I-I got into a fight at the hospital.

355
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:04,993
I fought with a doctor.

356
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:06,113
I thought it was about that.

357
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:10,152
Chief Xu.

358
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,632
How's it going?

359
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:14,872
He's denying it.

360
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:17,033
I heard the murder weapon wasn't found.

361
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:18,672
What about the DNA results?

362
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:21,073
Ziwu said they'll be out soon.

363
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:22,672
Hurry them up.

364
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:24,672
Okay, I'm on it.

365
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:31,513
Seen this girl before?

366
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:33,152
Yes.

367
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:35,712
Looks just like her.

368
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,472
She's obviously trouble.

369
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:41,993
Hanging out with a bunch of punks.

370
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:43,392
Completely thuggish.

371
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,273
My hands are definitely swollen.

372
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:46,152
Rub them later.

373
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:47,513
Got it. I'll rub them later.

374
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:54,593
What're you looking at?

375
00:25:57,672 --> 00:25:59,432
I'm talking to you.

376
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:01,753
And her?

377
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:06,553
I've seen her too.

378
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:12,392
You have no idea.

379
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:14,833
Her mother was awful.

380
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,232
Why isn't the bus here yet?

381
00:26:21,192 --> 00:26:23,033
Well? Did you remember
all you learned today?

382
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:27,273
It's 200 yuan a lesson.

383
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:28,793
You better study hard.

384
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,033
If you don't get
into a good high school,

385
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,553
you won't get into a good college.

386
00:26:33,152 --> 00:26:33,952
Can't you see?

387
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:35,392
So many graduates from good schools

388
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,232
can't even find jobs these days.

389
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:39,833
If you don't get into a good college,

390
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,593
you'll starve later.

391
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:44,993
It's coming.

392
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:03,232
You country bumpkin.

393
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:04,833
Stop pushing.

394
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:06,833
Trying to cop a feel, are you?

395
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,073
I'll call the cops on you.

396
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:15,392
Chief Xu,

397
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:17,273
it's been confirmed. Two days ago,

398
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:19,912
Jiang Lianhong did have a fight
with a doctor at City Hospital.

399
00:27:20,353 --> 00:27:21,833
Jiang Lianhong's dad has uremia.

400
00:27:21,993 --> 00:27:23,073
Whenever he has dialysis,

401
00:27:23,073 --> 00:27:25,033
Jiang Lianhong accompanies him.

402
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:27,472
According to nurses at City Hospital,

403
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:31,753
Jiang Lianhong often conflicts
with doctors over minor issues

404
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:32,833
and picks on them.

405
00:27:33,273 --> 00:27:34,273
It happened two days ago.

406
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:36,432
The doctor told him to wait outside

407
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:37,472
for his own turn.

408
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:39,033
And he attacked the doctor.

409
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,192
Quite the temper.

410
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:42,353
Well,

411
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:47,073
check Jiang Lianhong's dad's
medical records at the City Hospital.

412
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:50,833
See if there's any overlap in timing
with these three cases.

413
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,833
If there is, it means he had no time
to commit the crimes.

414
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:54,993
Get it checked out.

415
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:56,392
Okay, I'm on it.

416
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:00,632
I'm a laborer, so?

417
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:02,113
I was dirty, so?

418
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,593
So I couldn't ride the bus?

419
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:05,833
She dressed neatly and put on airs.

420
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,192
Her heart's filthy.

421
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:09,833
Those words from her.

422
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:11,632
I was embarrassed for that kid.

423
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:15,192
Seen her?

424
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,152
I haven't seen this one.

425
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,033
You sitting here

426
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:33,232
means we've got evidence
linking you to the crimes.

427
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,632
Confess now.

428
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:36,553
I really haven't seen her.

429
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:41,513
Did you think incense ash
would kill sperm

430
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,113
and destroy evidence?

431
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,392
What era do you think this is?

432
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,672
Who believes
in that kind of nonsense anymore?

433
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:50,672
You know what DNA is?

434
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:55,952
Your DNA was found
at all three crime scenes.

435
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:57,952
The match results are coming any moment.

436
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,073
Let's see what excuses you'll have left.

437
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:00,872
I...

438
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:06,232
Let's talk about this.

439
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:13,073
Nothing to talk about.

440
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,113
22 years ago,

441
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,353
your rape case confession stated

442
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:19,392
you denied it at first

443
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:21,273
and later admitted it.

444
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:22,672
Why?

445
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:24,472
Locked up for two years.

446
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:26,513
The village pointed fingers.

447
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:29,553
Now you're tied to rape-murder cases.

448
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,432
What will they think of you now?

449
00:29:35,392 --> 00:29:36,192
Jiang Lianhong,

450
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:41,353
your attitude now
is just like it was 22 years ago.

451
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,273
Your statements and the evidence
don't match up.

452
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,553
I admit to the case 22 years ago.

453
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,113
But not to these three cases.

454
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:50,872
I raped someone before,

455
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,232
so you pin these three on me too?

456
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:53,472
I didn't do it.

457
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:55,073
Then tell me.

458
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:58,353
When you were staring at Chen Xiaomeng

459
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,513
that day in the square,

460
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:02,993
what were you thinking?

461
00:30:06,192 --> 00:30:07,313
I've been out for some time.

462
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:10,273
I haven't even touched a woman's hand.

463
00:30:12,632 --> 00:30:14,113
Looking isn't illegal, is it?

464
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:15,872
Jiang Lianhong,

465
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,273
we're offering you a deal to confess.

466
00:30:18,273 --> 00:30:19,313
Turning it down?

467
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:24,192
Fine.

468
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:25,753
Take a look at this.

469
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:29,593
The ligature mark.

470
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:31,872
Remember it?

471
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,553
Think carefully.

472
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,912
Seems Jiang Lianhong knows

473
00:30:49,353 --> 00:30:52,392
this is the ligature mark
left by a hobble.

474
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:55,632
Why aren't the DNA results out yet?

475
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:56,993
I'll push them again.

476
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:01,793
He won't give in until he's cornered.

477
00:31:05,353 --> 00:31:06,313
I did it.

478
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:19,232
Chief Xu,

479
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:21,952
the results are in.

480
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:28,872
After I got out,

481
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:32,872
the whole village called me a rapist.

482
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:37,273
And my dad got uremia.

483
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:39,273
To this day,

484
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:43,672
no matchmaker has ever come to my home.

485
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:48,392
When I saw these girls,
I-I couldn't help it.

486
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:51,392
Which ones?

487
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:54,313
These three.

488
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:55,793
Why kill Guo Bingbing?

489
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,192
She saw my face.

490
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:59,872
How did you commit these three crimes?

491
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:01,793
I've confessed everything I should.

492
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:03,553
Sentence me however you want.

493
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:05,472
I have nothing more to say.

494
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:07,232
Nothing more to say?

495
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:09,912
Rape,

496
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,392
molestation,

497
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:12,513
and murder.

498
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,353
These are still kids in school.

499
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,073
What is human life to you?

500
00:32:17,192 --> 00:32:18,432
What do you take the law for?

501
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:19,833
Jiang Lianhong,

502
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:21,793
what exactly are you hiding?

503
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:22,712
Confess.

504
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,320
(Zhang Ziwu: The DNA results are in)

505
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:31,192
Captain Leng,

506
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:34,033
Jiang Lianhong's sample
doesn't match the ones from the scenes.

507
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:36,232
But the Y-chromosome match
is exceptionally high

508
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:37,553
with paternal lineage.

509
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:40,113
The real suspect should be
a male of the Jiang family.

510
00:32:42,632 --> 00:32:44,152
Reach him now. Call him.

511
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:45,672
Alright.

512
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,472
Where did I put my bag?

513
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:52,192
I-I need to grab my phone.

514
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:25,192
Why are you lying?

515
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:27,753
I'm not lying.

516
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:31,632
You knew who it was when you saw
the photo of the ligature mark, right?

517
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:33,048
I don't know.

518
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:34,273
I don't know what you mean.

519
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:35,753
I did the rape and the murder.

520
00:33:35,753 --> 00:33:36,513
It was all me.

521
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:37,952
Just arrest me. Sentence me.

522
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:39,833
The DNA results are back.

523
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:41,313
It wasn't you.

524
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:43,392
If you're locked away,

525
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,192
what about your dad?

526
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,033
Who exactly are you protecting?

527
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:03,833
Listen up, team.

528
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,513
Liu Yang,

529
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:05,912
check immediately

530
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:08,433
if Jiang Honghai returned home tonight.

531
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:09,712
Jiao,

532
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,832
keep working
with the ticketing platforms.

533
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,953
See if Jiang Honghai
booked any tickets for today.

534
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:17,312
Long-distance bus, train, or plane.

535
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:19,312
Ziwu and Long, come with me.

536
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:19,993
Let's go.

537
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:20,513
Yes.

538
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:36,712
Jiang,

539
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,513
when are you paying this month's rent?

540
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:21,873
Hello?

541
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:22,792
Captain Leng,

542
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:25,073
local police
at Jiang Honghai's hukou location

543
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:27,192
said he hasn't returned home
in six months.

544
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:35,832
Hold on.

545
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:37,953
Hold on.

546
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:42,473
(Yunxi International Airport
Ticketing Backend System)

547
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,993
Captain Leng, we found it.

548
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,632
Jiang Honghai booked a flight
to Shenzhen departing at 8:42 PM.

549
00:35:47,873 --> 00:35:49,352
He's likely through security by now.

550
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:53,752
Chief Xu,

551
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,712
we're on the way to the airport now.

552
00:35:57,272 --> 00:35:57,752
Yes.

553
00:35:57,752 --> 00:36:00,672
We've contacted the officers
at the airport.

554
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:02,953
They'll assist. Right.

555
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:06,232
We'll apprehend the suspect
the moment he appears.

556
00:36:06,473 --> 00:36:07,113
Rest assured.

557
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:08,672
Hurry.

558
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,548
(Sterile Room)

559
00:36:37,352 --> 00:36:38,073
Captain Leng,

560
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:41,672
DNA from the cigarette butts
perfectly matches Jiang Honghai.

561
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:50,073
The departure time has passed.

562
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:51,272
Jiang Honghai didn't board.

563
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,393
Okay, Master.

564
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,232
Jiang Honghai's gone.

565
00:37:22,513 --> 00:37:23,712
These are criminal cases.

566
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:26,152
Jiang Honghai is suspected
of rape and murder.

567
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:29,073
Have you considered the consequences?

568
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,033
How do you know he did it?

569
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:40,553
Listen, you better do this wall right.

570
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:41,832
I know how you guys work.

571
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:42,873
Don't worry.

572
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:44,553
Leave it to me. You can count on it.

573
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:45,880
Hurry up. Come on.

574
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,632
We're in a hurry.

575
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:48,073
Yes, hurry up.

576
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:48,632
Hurry up.

577
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:49,832
Don't worry, ma'am.

578
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:25,993
Hello? You're here?

579
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,352
I'll be right out.

580
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:30,832
I'll call the cops on you.

581
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:32,433
Bad guy!

582
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:33,352
Stay away from us.

583
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:54,513
Here.

584
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:57,473
Use this ruler
to measure this wall properly.

585
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:08,593
How much?

586
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:09,993
2.5 meters.

587
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,632
You've got it crooked.

588
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:12,672
Move it higher up here.

589
00:39:16,073 --> 00:39:17,433
(Why are you covering for him?)

590
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:19,672
Honghai treated me well.

591
00:39:22,352 --> 00:39:23,792
After I got out,

592
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:26,152
he gave me money,

593
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,033
pulled strings to get me a job,

594
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,433
and even found me a place to live.

595
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,433
Jiang Honghai
can't just vanish into thin air.

596
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:38,873
Where is he?

597
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:43,792
I really don't know.

598
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:51,033
Brief the interrogation results.

599
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,993
Jiang Honghai is currently missing.

600
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,232
But what we can confirm is

601
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,553
he hasn't left Yunxi City yet.

602
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:01,232
Any new leads on Jiang Lianhong?

603
00:40:01,752 --> 00:40:02,752
Not yet.

604
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,632
He claims he doesn't know
Jiang Honghai's close private contacts.

605
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,152
Sounds like he's playing us.

606
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:10,433
Possibly.

607
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:13,033
Captain Leng, food's here.

608
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:14,033
Everyone, let's eat.

609
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:14,553
Okay.

610
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,953
Whoever's hungry, dig in. Come on.

611
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:18,792
Let's make it quick.

612
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:20,152
Go on.

613
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,913
So, as long as
we catch Jiang Honghai now,

614
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:25,513
everything will fall into place.

615
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:26,352
Right?

616
00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:28,352
I'll be on it tomorrow.

617
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:29,873
As long as he's still in Yunxi,

618
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:31,232
he'll surface eventually.

619
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:33,953
Why hasn't Jiang Honghai fled?

620
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:36,393
Master.

621
00:40:37,152 --> 00:40:38,393
Jiang Lianhong said

622
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,832
Chen Xiaomeng looks
very like someone he knows.

623
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:47,553
Don't you guys think Chen Xiaomeng

624
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:50,513
looks a bit like He Jie?

625
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:53,232
Especially around the eyes and eyebrows.

626
00:40:53,272 --> 00:40:56,344
(Chen Xiaomeng, He Jie,
Li Ying, Guo Bingbing)

627
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:58,553
Jiang Lianhong is definitely hiding

628
00:40:58,553 --> 00:40:59,473
something else.

629
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:05,232
Check again if Jiang Lianhong
and Jiang Honghai contacted anyone else.

630
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:07,873
According to Jiang Lianhong's coworkers,

631
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:11,553
they often go to a restaurant
on Huaibei Road after work.

632
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:13,953
Maybe that place holds some clues.

633
00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:16,232
Jiao, here's the plan.

634
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:21,993
Review footage from Huaibei Road
and Chen Xiaomeng's place.

635
00:41:22,632 --> 00:41:25,232
See if Jiang Honghai
was caught by the camera.

636
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:27,632
Ye and Long,

637
00:41:27,712 --> 00:41:29,033
head to Chen Xiaomeng's place.

638
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,033
- Hurry.
- Yes.

639
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:30,712
Thanks.

640
00:41:31,152 --> 00:41:31,873
Wang Tong.

641
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:33,152
And Liu Yang.

642
00:41:33,553 --> 00:41:34,832
Let's go have a chat with...

643
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:36,752
- Jiang Lianhong.
- Jiang Lianhong.

644
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:10,873
Hello, Mom.

645
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:13,152
I'm downstairs.

646
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,312
You're coming to get me?

647
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:16,272
No need.

648
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,672
I'm almost there.

649
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:41,832
Chen Xiaomeng.

650
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:49,752
Are you okay?

651
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:51,553
Police. Don't run.

652
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:56,232
It's okay now. It's okay.
