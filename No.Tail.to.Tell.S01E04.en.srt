1
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,961
NO TAIL TO TELL

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,171
SEOUL SANGSEO POLICE STATION

3
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,053
Damn it.

4
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,143
Mr. Kang, you can step out now.

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,820
You just keep outdoing yourself.

6
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,614
You're really a piece of work, aren't you?

7
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,620
Hey, Si-yeol.

8
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,081
What?

9
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,752
Are you acting out
because I told you to quit soccer?

10
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,797
No, it's not like that.

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,967
Jeez, you're a total nutjob.

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,595
Is apologizing to me that difficult?

13
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,849
You've got a seriously nasty temper.

14
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,726
Seriously.

15
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,647
Fine.

16
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,065
You win.

17
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,486
Come back to training tomorrow.

18
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,779
But on one condition.

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,824
You'd better get your head in the game.

20
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,784
Listen.

21
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,414
Let's win the championship this season
and get promoted to the third division.

22
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,214
Are you crazy?

23
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,221
You expect me to play
in the fourth division?

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,891
Are you out of your mind?

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,565
I can't live like that.

26
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:29,983
No.

27
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,110
I won't, damn it!

28
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,988
Seriously…

29
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,787
Seriously, what the hell
is wrong with him?

30
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,259
- Hey, Woo-seok.
- Si-yeol.

31
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,302
Where are you right now?

32
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,679
Are you in London too?

33
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,931
Actually, Woo-seok…

34
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,684
- The thing is--
- No, wait.

35
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,645
Let's just meet up.

36
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,814
Let's talk in person.

37
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,192
I think

38
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,820
I've become a Premier League player.

39
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,406
That's the thing, Woo-seok--

40
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,325
It's all thanks to you, Si-yeol.

41
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,078
Hey, Woo-seok.

42
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,789
The thing is,

43
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,126
our fates have been switched.

44
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,339
What do you mean, switched?

45
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,843
You became
a Premier League player instead of me.

46
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:42,055
And I'm playing
in the fourth division instead of you.

47
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,980
Woo-seok?

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,776
So what do we do now?

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,446
What happens now?

50
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,823
Well, I asked.

51
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,743
She says you have to wish

52
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,829
to have our fates switched back.

53
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,956
A wish?

54
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,542
I have to make a wish?

55
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:15,297
Yes, because I don't have
anything left to pay for a wish.

56
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,592
I see.

57
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,428
Can you check your pockets or your bag?

58
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,930
Her business card
should be in there somewhere.

59
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,682
Woo-seok, come out here for a minute.

60
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,350
Just a second.

61
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,776
Si-yeol, hang on. I'll call you back.

62
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,611
Woo-seok? Hello?

63
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,820
Woo-seok, wait--

64
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,635
Woo-seok, do you have any idea
how crazy things are right now?

65
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,846
The clubs are fighting over
who's going to sign you,

66
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,598
and the reporters keep calling.

67
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,310
God, having such a perfect son
is exhausting!

68
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,943
Okay, today's the day.
Let's lock in your team!

69
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,529
And when your transfer fee comes through,

70
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,155
can I get…

71
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,616
a new car?

72
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,622
- Dad--
- I know.

73
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,334
I know we have plenty of cars, but…

74
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,336
Dad.

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,006
You're happy, right?

76
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,425
What?

77
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,262
Of course I am.

78
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,598
Thanks to you, I've got it pretty good.

79
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,100
Of course I'm happy.

80
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,939
I really was hoping for that one car.

81
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,876
Hello? Hey, Woo-seok.
Did you find the business card?

82
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,588
Well, the thing is…

83
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,673
What, it's not there?

84
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,759
No, that's not it.

85
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,803
Then what is it?

86
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,765
Do we really
have to switch back right now?

87
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,561
What… do you mean?

88
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,355
Just one month.
Let's switch back in a month.

89
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,941
I promise I'll switch us back then.

90
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,861
- Hey!
- If we're switching back anyway,

91
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,822
does it matter when we do it?

92
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,283
Of course it does.

93
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,828
Just give me a little more time.

94
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,415
Hey, Woo-seok.

95
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,792
You can't do this. Please.

96
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:58,835
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,795
Woo-seok!

98
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,257
Hyeon Woo-seok! Oh, come on!

99
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,177
I'm screwed!

100
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,387
I'm seriously screwed!

101
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,431
Damn it!

102
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,620
Damn.

103
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,844
REPUBLIC OF KOREA PASSPORT
KANG SI-YEOL

104
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,436
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

105
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,401
One ticket to London, please.
The earliest available.

106
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,903
- Would you like a round-trip ticket?
- No, one-way.

107
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,324
Excuse me.

108
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,994
It looks like your passport has expired.

109
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:14,953
What?

110
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,247
Then what do I do?

111
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,749
I have to get to London right now.

112
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,335
And here I thought
your friendship was special.

113
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,878
Not so special after all.

114
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,964
You!

115
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,135
Have you learned your lesson?

116
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,554
I'm not really fond of stupid humans.

117
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,432
Learned what lesson, exactly?

118
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,934
You think I'm the one who needs a lesson?

119
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,644
Apparently not.

120
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,187
Wait!

121
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,356
I seriously can't live like this.

122
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,984
Put me back!

123
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,737
Please.

124
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,120
You shouldn't have been
so cocky in the first place.

125
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,791
Well, that should do it.
I guess I've tamed you enough.

126
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,460
Shall we end this here?

127
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,797
When you wake up tomorrow,
everything will be back to normal.

128
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,633
- Really?
- Yes.

129
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,635
If you ever make a wish,

130
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,265
always remember what happened today.

131
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,727
So you don't make the same mistake
with me ever again.

132
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,024
And from now on,
don't be so quick to trust people.

133
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,401
Consider it a free lesson from me.

134
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,620
Man…

135
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,998
Seriously.

136
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,670
I'll never make a wish again.

137
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,757
Not even if my life depends on it.

138
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,175
Never, damn it.

139
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,113
Sorry.

140
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,291
What?

141
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,546
What was that?

142
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,266
Where to?

143
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,406
I'm sorry. I thought this was a taxi.

144
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,741
You're right. It is a taxi.

145
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,410
But…

146
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,203
VACANT

147
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,833
Sir.

148
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,630
I'll take you exactly
where you need to be.

149
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,063
EPISODE 4
THE PRICE OF GOOD DEEDS

150
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,461
Who are you people?

151
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,664
What's with the weather all of a sudden?

152
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,332
Something feels wrong.

153
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,921
Stay still.

154
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,507
Who the hell are you people?

155
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,093
What are you doing?

156
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,099
It's not here.

157
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,101
That's impossible. Look again.

158
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,732
Look for yourself then. It's not here.

159
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,943
You've got the wrong person.

160
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,112
I have jack squat right now.

161
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,031
I won't call the police,
so just let me go.

162
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,701
Shut up.

163
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,040
There's no business card
or anything remotely like it.

164
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,418
Are you sure this is the right guy?

165
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,472
I'll get straight to the point.

166
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,016
We're looking for something.

167
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,686
Hand it over,
and I promise nothing will happen to you.

168
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,108
You have the wish-granting
business card, don't you?

169
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,110
A business card?

170
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,403
That's right.

171
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,530
I have some business with that fox.

172
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,993
Unbelievable.

173
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,832
You did all this just for that?

174
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,710
Kidnapping an innocent guy
and tying him up?

175
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,296
Fine, I get it.

176
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,215
Just untie me first.

177
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,925
I'll just summon her for you.

178
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,635
You think this is a joke?

179
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,928
Hold it!

180
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,311
What did you just say?

181
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,649
You don't even have the card.
How are you going to summon her?

182
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,407
Dad, should we go look at some watches?

183
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,994
No, I'm good.
Let's find something for you instead.

184
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,996
You've already bought me plenty today.

185
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,250
Who knows when we'll have
a day like this again?

186
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,711
I really want to buy you one.

187
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,713
It's not like this is our only chance.

188
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,386
But I wonder if they still have
that limited edition.

189
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,096
- Let's go look.
- Shall we?

190
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,847
Hold on.

191
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,475
SI-YEOL

192
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,150
Who is it? Why didn't you pick up?

193
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,903
It's okay. I don't need to take that call.

194
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,987
Let's hurry.

195
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,198
We should go check out some cars later.

196
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,324
Really?

197
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,743
But that can wait
until the transfer talks are--

198
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,203
You said you wanted one.

199
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,831
Why wait? Let's buy it now.

200
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,791
Okay, then. Let's go.

201
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,798
Why isn't he picking up?

202
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,638
Just wait.
I'll get her here for sure, okay?

203
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,355
By the way, I don't know
what wish you're trying to make,

204
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,524
but you may want
to think it through one more time.

205
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,985
Thanks to that crazy fox…

206
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,116
Anyhow, wishes don't work
the way you think they do.

207
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,826
I know.

208
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,328
I'm not going to make a wish.

209
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,040
Then why are you
looking for the nine-tailed fox?

210
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,750
We're going to kill her.

211
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,546
You're going to kill her?

212
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,466
It's not for a wish?

213
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,224
Hey!

214
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,436
Hello?

215
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,564
Hey, Woo-seok.

216
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,529
Look, I'm a bit busy right now,
so I missed your call.

217
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,200
Okay…

218
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,703
Si-yeol.

219
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,039
I'm begging you, please.

220
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,875
I just need a month.

221
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,835
That's all I'm asking.

222
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,757
We're going to kill her.

223
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,550
Si-yeol?

224
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,137
Look, Woo-seok.

225
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,890
Let me call you back.

226
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,102
What are you doing?

227
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,525
I don't think this'll work.

228
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,530
Look, I don't like
that nine-tailed fox either.

229
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,617
But still, you don't have to kill her.

230
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,744
Fine.

231
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,206
If that's how you feel, then so be it.

232
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,626
We'll just have to find another way.

233
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,510
What is this?

234
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,874
I'm about to lose a huge chunk
of my spiritual power again.

235
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,018
I was wondering what was going on with me.

236
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,145
I should've known it was you.

237
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,399
Wait.

238
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,570
What is all this?

239
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,699
Look at you, crawling in here
not knowing this is where you'll die.

240
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,041
I recognize that face.

241
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,632
And you're that male shaman!

242
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,927
Your name…

243
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,221
was it Jang Do-cheol?

244
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,099
You're quite the wicked creature.

245
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,309
How did you know my name?

246
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,605
Oh my gosh!

247
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,195
Did you

248
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,905
trap me in here?

249
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,449
I spent years researching this.

250
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,411
You won't be able to do a thing in there.

251
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,247
Not even a centuries-old nine-tailed fox.

252
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,459
A human after a fox bead…

253
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,338
There used to be a few like you.

254
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:20,511
Ever wonder what happened to them?

255
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,187
Rumor has it

256
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,692
this dagger can cut through anything.

257
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,987
Humans, ghosts,

258
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,865
and even fate decreed by Heaven.

259
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,629
How disappointing.

260
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,842
I thought a centuries-old nine-tailed fox
would be different.

261
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,446
Are you about to leave?

262
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,745
The time has come, so I must.

263
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,875
Is your long watch finally over?

264
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,852
What?

265
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,524
Well?

266
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,400
Not so disappointing now, am I?

267
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,617
That really hurts.

268
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,078
It hurts!

269
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,414
Now do you wonder?

270
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,543
About what happened
to the humans who dared chase my fox bead.

271
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,128
How on earth…

272
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,922
It seemed like you were
digging into my past,

273
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,507
so I did some digging on you too.

274
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,636
Jang Do-cheol, 54 years old.

275
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,555
And?

276
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,932
And he's a former high-flying
fund manager.

277
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,935
He chose his profession wisely.

278
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,689
With his powers, he must've predicted
every stock price perfectly.

279
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,066
And he probably mistook it
for his own talent.

280
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,985
Anything else?

281
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,113
Ten years ago,
he quit a perfectly stable job

282
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,658
and has been wandering since,
with nowhere to call home.

283
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,620
His last known address is right here.

284
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,458
ID CERTIFICATE: JANG DO-CHEOL
YANGHEUNG-GUN, GANGWON-DO

285
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,933
I came to see if I could find anything,

286
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,936
but it looks like this will take a while.

287
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,788
If you have something to say, go ahead.

288
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,582
I'm listening.

289
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,212
What are you going to do with me?

290
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,798
I'm not sure.

291
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,176
Nothing at all, actually.

292
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,221
- What?
- You don't have long to live anyway.

293
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:52,848
You know that already.

294
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,685
You're destined
for a particularly miserable death.

295
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,397
So why should I bother
getting my hands dirty?

296
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,863
And as for you.

297
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,074
I'll be coming for you soon

298
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,327
since you clearly
haven't learned your lesson.

299
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,537
No!

300
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,625
This wasn't even my idea.

301
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,169
That guy made me do all of this.

302
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,185
I once heard someone say…

303
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,271
Damn it!

304
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,107
What is it now?

305
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,197
You…

306
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,343
…"Heaven's net is vast and wide,

307
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,221
yet nothing slips through."

308
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,313
What a joke.

309
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,191
Deities have no interest in humans.

310
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:31,196
There's no world
where the guilty are justly punished.

311
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:38,203
So I just need to deceive them
enough to get by as well.

312
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,456
Get up, Kang Si-yeol.

313
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,878
It'll be quite inconvenient for me
if you die like this.

314
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,697
If you're going to die, do it tomorrow.
Don't make it my problem.

315
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,577
If you die with your fate switched,

316
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,455
the ones above
will find out what I'm up to.

317
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,457
And that would be

318
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,126
extremely annoying for me.

319
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,087
Hey,

320
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,130
are you okay?

321
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,050
What happened to those people?

322
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,470
Why?

323
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,721
Planning on getting revenge?

324
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,057
Did you…

325
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,102
kill them?

326
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:45,938
What?

327
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,898
You must've forgotten already.

328
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,525
I don't kill humans.

329
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,236
Right.

330
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,783
Though I will pay them a visit soon
and make their lives a living hell.

331
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,369
Anyway.

332
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,250
I'm sorry.

333
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,669
What?

334
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,383
I feel like you got dragged
into this because of me.

335
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,973
Are you just going to sit there?

336
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,183
Get up. I'll take you home.

337
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,727
Yeah, okay.

338
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,101
I told you

339
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,229
this would happen,

340
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,855
Geum-ho.

341
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,983
You never once came to look for me.

342
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,611
Not when your child was sick,

343
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,905
or even after they died.

344
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,908
Not when your family was ruined,

345
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,827
when your husband died,
or when you were left to starve.

346
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,664
While you were living that miserable life,

347
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,043
why did you never once ask me
to grant you a wish?

348
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,754
You never gave me the chance to help you.

349
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,930
I smell the earth on you, miss.

350
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,642
It smells like the place

351
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,104
where I once lived, long ago.

352
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,319
I told you that you'd be miserable.

353
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,323
You knew you'd forget
everything in the end

354
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,035
and die as a lonely, withered old woman.

355
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,415
Why did you choose to endure it all?

356
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:53,875
Oh my.

357
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,878
You're such a beauty.

358
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,340
My, how beautiful you are.

359
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,055
I came to say goodbye.

360
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,434
Because you're going to die today.

361
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,355
There was something I needed to say.

362
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,152
I will never become human.

363
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,116
I won't love a human as you did.

364
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,119
I won't live in misery,
and I won't die in despair.

365
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,747
I'll never

366
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,916
live like you.

367
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,509
Gosh. Ma'am!

368
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,844
Ma'am!

369
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,138
- Oh gosh. Ma'am!
- My goodness.

370
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,515
- Goodness!
- Gosh.

371
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,725
Ma'am!

372
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,769
There she is.

373
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,939
Good grief. This senile old woman
is always wandering back here.

374
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,900
She can't even find her own home anymore.

375
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,277
How does she find
this place so well every time?

376
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,237
The sun's setting. Let's go.

377
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,953
Ma'am.

378
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,500
No…

379
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,418
Oh no. Ma'am!

380
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,881
Goodness me.

381
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,133
Ma'am…

382
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,053
Oh no.

383
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,140
Oh no. Ma'am! Poor thing!

384
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,701
Wait.

385
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,787
Are you crying?

386
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,087
Where am I?

387
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,797
I brought you here.

388
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,174
Are you feeling better?

389
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,426
The light's so bright.

390
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,810
What's wrong now?

391
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,080
What's wrong with me?

392
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,598
What just happened?

393
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,057
How is this possible?

394
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,686
- What did I do to deserve--
- What is it? What's wrong?

395
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,734
Yes, you.

396
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,737
It's because of you.
This is all your fault!

397
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,031
Why is it my fault again?

398
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,158
Do you know what I went through
because of you?

399
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,409
That's not the point!

400
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,911
Then what is?

401
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,162
I…

402
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,707
I've become human.

403
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,627
What?

404
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,421
I've become human because of you!

405
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,219
INN

406
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:41,937
Where are you going?

407
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,524
We should go our separate ways now.

408
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,859
What about me then?

409
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,402
What am I supposed to do?

410
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,281
Move to a new place every day.

411
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,533
What?

412
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,952
Don't stay in one place for too long.

413
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,788
That way, she'll have a harder time
finding your energy.

414
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,997
Hey, wait!

415
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,085
That's it?

416
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,920
What if that fox finds me here?

417
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,757
Maybe you're fine with dying,
but what about me?

418
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,593
That's not really my problem.

419
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,565
Calm down.

420
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,443
Explain it so I can understand.

421
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,992
I've become human.

422
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,952
What more is there to explain?

423
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,580
But is that really such a big deal?

424
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,915
What?

425
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,544
I mean, nine-tailed foxes eat
human livers to become human.

426
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,546
At least, that's what the stories say.

427
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,340
Are you out of your mind?

428
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:57,429
If you were me, would you really choose
to lose your powers, grow old and sick,

429
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,639
and die before even reaching a hundred?

430
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,892
- You think I'd eat a liver just for that?
- All right.

431
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,811
I get it.

432
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,523
Then how did this happen?

433
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,818
You wouldn't have suddenly
become human for no reason.

434
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,153
That's…

435
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,990
because I saved your life.

436
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,580
As you were dying,
I was losing my spiritual power.

437
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,542
So I saved you
just to stop that from happening.

438
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,463
But how can they count that
as a good deed?

439
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,131
How does that even add up?

440
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,967
Do they have any idea
how many terrible things I've done?

441
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,386
All because I saved one meager life?

442
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,726
Well, I agree.

443
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,561
You're not fit to be human yet.

444
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,855
There must've been some mistake.

445
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,899
You think so too, right?

446
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,780
Anyway, since you became
human against your will,

447
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,240
I really do feel for you.

448
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:07,332
But there is something
I've been wanting to ask.

449
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,627
What's that?

450
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,881
When exactly will I go back
to how things were?

451
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,551
What?

452
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,929
You said so last night.

453
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,057
That everything would be back
to normal by morning.

454
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,934
And it's morning.

455
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,853
Actually, it's already past morning.
It's lunchtime.

456
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,690
When will it switch back?

457
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,195
Have you even been listening to me?

458
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,698
I'm human now.

459
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,991
So?

460
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:45,995
I'm human now, so how am I supposed
to turn things back the way they were?

461
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,917
Wait, what are you talking about?

462
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,293
No way.

463
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,629
You're joking, aren't you?

464
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,215
Does it look like I'm joking?

465
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,009
This isn't a joke. This is hell.

466
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:04,848
No, no. This can't be happening.
Please don't do this to me!

467
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,685
Are you saying
I have to keep living like this?

468
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,064
Yes, for the time being.

469
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,400
"For the time being"?

470
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,776
For how long?

471
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,320
A few weeks?

472
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,239
Well…

473
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,199
A few months?

474
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,369
Say something!

475
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,789
What are you going to do?
There's no way I can live like this!

476
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,541
Do you think I want to live like this?

477
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,170
Then do something! Anything!

478
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,963
There has to be a way, right?

479
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,757
Do you even have to ask?

480
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,509
If there isn't a way, I'll make one.

481
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,650
Could you have gone any slower?
I said I was in a hurry.

482
00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,986
I'm sorry.

483
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,156
I'm really sorry.

484
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,457
That temper of yours, seriously.

485
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,419
What are we doing here anyway?

486
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,755
I have some things to say
and questions to ask.

487
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,090
Something definitely went wrong.

488
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,684
You there, could you leave for a moment?

489
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,561
I have some business here.

490
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,730
- Hey.
- What?

491
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,857
He is

492
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,818
no longer here.

493
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,070
What?

494
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,197
He left last night.

495
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,659
That crazy old geezer!

496
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:54,541
Since you've come all this way,
why don't you stay for some tea?

497
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,262
Where did he go?

498
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,389
I wouldn't know.

499
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:14,310
How could a mere monk
fathom the divine will?

500
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,146
There's something I need answers to.

501
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,526
So I'd appreciate it if you could
just tell me where he went.

502
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,903
He didn't say.

503
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:28,116
But he told me to give you this.

504
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,496
Since you'll be living
in the human world now,

505
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,416
he said it's something
you'll definitely need.

506
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,387
What is this?

507
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,600
Your name is Ok-sun.
"Ok" for jade, and "Sun" for pure.

508
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:58,187
Lord Pagun hoped
that choosing a name like this for you

509
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,566
would help you rein in your temper.

510
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,775
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

511
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,493
How did it go?

512
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,495
Is there a way?

513
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,665
Hey, say something.

514
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,501
How did it go?

515
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,296
STORAGE ROOM

516
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,259
What are you doing?

517
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,845
Hey.

518
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,141
Carry this and follow me.

519
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,186
What are these for?

520
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,147
What are you doing?

521
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,651
What is…

522
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,029
Gosh, that smell! Are you crazy?

523
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,572
Hey!

524
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,617
I'm going to burn
this place to the ground!

525
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,576
Jeez!

526
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,579
Let me go!

527
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,289
Excuse me, what's going on?

528
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,333
Let me go!

529
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,544
I'm going to burn this place down!

530
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,297
I'm going to burn this place down!

531
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,257
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!

532
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,137
- Why are you doing this?
- Put me down!

533
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,309
TRUSTED POLICE
WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE

534
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,732
The head monk spoke up for you.

535
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,193
He said you'd be able to
get out tomorrow morning.

536
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,653
Tomorrow morning?

537
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,447
Are you kidding me?
Tell them to let me out now.

538
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,701
You're here for attempted arson.

539
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,829
You should be grateful
they're letting you out tomorrow.

540
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,331
Can't we just pay them off or something?

541
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,874
Where would I get the money?

542
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,418
I'm broke because of you.

543
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,211
Whatever. This is pathetic.

544
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,547
Good grief.

545
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,549
Grab those two blankets over there.

546
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,093
There won't be any left
when the drunks get here.

547
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,847
By the way,
where's my wooden-handled dagger?

548
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,015
What?

549
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,558
The dagger I had.

550
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,019
It was gone when I woke up.

551
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,730
Don't tell me.

552
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,315
Did you not bring it yesterday?

553
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,194
Was there a dagger?

554
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,198
Oh, that.

555
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,325
I was all over the place yesterday.

556
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,703
You left it behind?

557
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,789
Yes. Was it important?

558
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,167
Go and get it right now!

559
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,376
Right now?

560
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,046
You want me to go back there?

561
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,757
Why? You want to wait until next year?

562
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,633
That's not what I meant.

563
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:38,139
After everything that happened yesterday,
how can I go back there alone this late?

564
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:42,477
Let's just wait until morning
and go together, okay?

565
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,939
It's the only Sajin Ritual Blade
left in the world.

566
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,026
Sajin… what?

567
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,571
It's a sacred dagger
that can sever and defy fate.

568
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,366
If we want to get things back
to how they were…

569
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,495
we might need it.

570
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,751
Jeez.

571
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,060
Is this the place?

572
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,728
Yes.

573
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,481
The NASDAQ is about to open.

574
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,941
Where are we going at this hour?

575
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,401
Jeez!

576
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,529
What is this place?

577
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,615
Where are we?
What are we looking for here?

578
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,911
There's a lot of weird stuff in there,

579
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,955
so don't be too shocked.

580
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,332
Weird stuff like what?

581
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,417
Hey, wait.

582
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,880
Si-yeol!

583
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,924
Damn it.

584
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,824
Oh, jeez.

585
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,790
Wait, why is it…

586
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,338
What's wrong? What's supposed to be here?

587
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,090
What is it?

588
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,426
- There's nothing here, Beom.
- What?

589
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,056
Seriously.

590
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,435
It's just a construction site.

591
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,022
You say there's something here?
Looks like there's nothing at all.

592
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,232
Are you okay, Si-yeol?

593
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,818
Yeah.

594
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,553
Top teams

595
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:26,265
from all over the world made offers.

596
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,272
Stop it, Dad.

597
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,454
Ms. Kim Ok-sun, you can come out now.

598
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,004
Ms. Kim Ok-sun.

599
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,131
I said, you can come out now.

600
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,016
I told you yesterday.

601
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,559
My name's not Kim Ok-sun.

602
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,020
Then are you going to stay in here?

603
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,739
I am coming out.

604
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,242
But I'm not Kim Ok-sun.

605
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,862
Hey.

606
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,156
How can I help you?

607
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,407
Call Kang Si-yeol for me.

608
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,244
- I'm sorry, who?
- I just got released from here,

609
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,997
but Si-yeol isn't here yet.
Tell him to get here fast.

610
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,169
This isn't the place for jokes.
Please leave.

611
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,629
Hey!

612
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,094
Kang Si-yeol?

613
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,304
I thought you'd abandoned me.

614
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,557
What are you talking about?
Why would I do that?

615
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,392
I need you more than ever right now.

616
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,351
Really?

617
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,311
Get in. We're going to Seoraksan Mountain.

618
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:01,605
We have to hurry before it closes. Get in.

619
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,816
Buckle up.

620
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,696
- Hurry up. Come on.
- Okay.

621
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,490
Okay, here we go.

622
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,034
Let's go.

623
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,248
Why Seoraksan Mountain all of a sudden?

624
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,041
Do you think we have time for that?

625
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,626
I found something.

626
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,962
Right. Did you find
the wooden-handled dagger?

627
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:29,216
No. When I got there,
there was nothing left.

628
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,971
The dagger was gone,
and so was all the shaman stuff.

629
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,097
What?

630
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,767
Then what on earth did you find?

631
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,186
Another

632
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,605
nine-tailed fox.

633
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,482
What?

634
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,862
How long are we staying here?

635
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,322
There's nothing there.

636
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,290
COUPLE SAVED BY NINE-TAILED FOX
STARTS NEW LIFE THROUGH VOLUNTEERING

637
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,835
That's absolute nonsense.

638
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,838
There is no other nine-tailed fox
in this land besides me.

639
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,216
How can you be so sure?

640
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,592
I just am.

641
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,346
If there were another being like me,
we would sense each other's energy.

642
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,347
Even from a distance.

643
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,724
Then what about those people?

644
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,018
They're just talking nonsense.

645
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,478
Humans are always like that.

646
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,105
They either hallucinated
or just wanted attention.

647
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,566
They didn't seem like that.

648
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,153
How would you know?

649
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,073
Because I met them myself.

650
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:39,578
Gosh, I really thought
I was going to die that day.

651
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,708
I think it was around 2 or 3 p.m.
when we entered Dinosaur Ridge.

652
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,835
Sometime around then.

653
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:50,798
But since it was winter,
the sun went down so fast.

654
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,508
It was freezing cold,

655
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,761
and we'd been hiking all day,
so we were exhausted.

656
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,347
We couldn't see a thing in front of us.

657
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,268
But she suddenly said
she was getting sleepy.

658
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,853
It was because of hypothermia.

659
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,065
If that happens on a mountain,
you're in big trouble.

660
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:13,195
I forced her to stay awake
and was dragging her along

661
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,156
when she suddenly appeared.

662
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,121
She was a very pretty young lady.

663
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:26,584
She suddenly appeared and asked,
"Would you like some help?"

664
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,587
We thought we were seeing things.

665
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,592
So we asked who she was
and if she was a ghost.

666
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:39,763
She said she was a fox trying
to become human by doing good deeds.

667
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:44,101
Anyway, she lit a fire for us
and helped us find our way.

668
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,604
So, thankfully, we made it back alive.

669
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,273
She said she was a fox, right?

670
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,233
The young woman said that herself?

671
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:54,612
I understand if you don't believe us.

672
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,739
But it's true.

673
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,074
Actually, there are
a few others besides us.

674
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,243
A few others?

675
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,370
After the article came out,

676
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,707
a lot of people got in touch,
not just you.

677
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,419
They all said they were saved
by that young lady on Seoraksan Mountain.

678
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,632
By the way,

679
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,925
you said there was nothing there, right?

680
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,135
What?

681
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,056
You said there were no shamanic items
and no Sajin Ritual Blade either.

682
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,223
Oh, that.

683
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,226
It was spotless,
as if someone had swept it clean.

684
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,979
Who could have cleaned the place up
overnight like that?

685
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,982
Maybe those guys came and went last night.

686
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,233
Not likely.

687
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,111
They wouldn't know that I've become human.

688
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,447
Why would they risk going back there?

689
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,074
And how could they have known

690
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,701
that you were stupid enough
to leave the dagger?

691
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,161
Hey!

692
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,121
Come on, that's not the point.

693
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,625
What do you think
about what I said earlier?

694
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:53,712
If we find that fox on the mountain,
couldn't she turn things back to normal?

695
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,923
Don't you think it's strange?

696
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,091
What is?

697
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,219
A deserted construction site wiped clean,

698
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,763
and a newspaper scrap
about a nine-tailed fox

699
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,683
lying around
as if it were deliberately left there.

700
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,143
I guess…

701
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:10,813
Take it out.

702
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,066
Sure.

703
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,282
COUPLE SAVED BY NINE-TAILED FOX…

704
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,701
SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1997

705
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,996
See? I knew it.

706
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,832
What?

707
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,291
Look at the date.

708
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,292
NOVEMBER 16, 1997

709
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,086
This newspaper is over 20 years old.

710
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,880
Isn't this a bit too convenient
to be a coincidence?

711
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,883
Someone is pulling the strings here.

712
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,343
Who?

713
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,930
Probably those guys up there.

714
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,267
That's just how deities treat humans.

715
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,729
Under the pretext of things like
fate or coincidence,

716
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,605
they manipulate humans however they want.

717
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:58,861
So there's no nine-tailed fox
on Seoraksan Mountain?

718
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,405
I wouldn't know.

719
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,367
Whether there's an actual nine-tailed fox
and they're sending us there,

720
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,036
or if there's another reason for this.

721
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,038
Let's go.

722
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:13,876
I need to see for myself
what they're up to.

723
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,321
Is that Park Bi-ryong?

724
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,491
How nice.

725
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,244
Do you know this bear?

726
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:59,129
The sun will be setting soon.

727
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,926
Wouldn't it be better to sleep nearby
and hike up tomorrow?

728
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,136
We're trying to get stranded anyway.

729
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,057
But aren't we a little unprepared?

730
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,142
You do have a plan, right?

731
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:18,065
It's just one night on a mountain.
Why are you making such a fuss?

732
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,608
Have you forgotten who I am?

733
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,568
I lived on a mountain for centuries.

734
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,279
Just follow me.

735
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:32,621
Wait for me.

736
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,509
Are you all right?

737
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,971
Go. Just keep going.

738
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,897
Eat this and hang in there.
You're still so young.

739
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,573
Just how much steeper does this get?

740
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,159
This useless human body.

741
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:29,970
Hey, young man!

742
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,931
- Take these with you.
- Pardon?

743
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,768
- No, I'm okay.
- Just take them with you.

744
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,478
And also…

745
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,400
Here, take this.

746
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,529
If you give all of this to me…

747
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,822
It's fine.

748
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,533
But…

749
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,330
What's wrong with humans today?

750
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,707
They keep giving us things,

751
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,418
looking at us with teary eyes,
and holding our hands.

752
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,004
Do we look that pathetic?

753
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,675
Excuse me!

754
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:11,595
Hold on a second.

755
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,600
Yes? How can I help you?

756
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,185
We received a report.

757
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,566
I'm telling you, it's not like that.

758
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,818
Who said anyone was going to die?

759
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,279
- Jeez.
- Are you sure?

760
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:32,783
If you weren't thinking such things,

761
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,410
why would you climb the mountain
at this hour dressed like that?

762
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,746
We've received several reports.

763
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,123
I don't know what you're going through,

764
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,334
but you're a young couple
with a future ahead of you.

765
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,502
Please think it over.

766
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,003
- No--
- We're not a couple.

767
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,422
And we're not here to die,
so just let us go.

768
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:52,344
We were dragged down for nothing.
How are we supposed to get back up?

769
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,845
You're going back up?

770
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,640
Of course I am.
Why else would I have come this far?

771
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,726
Goodness, you have no idea
how dangerous mountains are.

772
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,313
Anyway, you can't go up now.
You can't see anything, and it's cold.

773
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:08,026
Even expert hikers would be
in serious trouble without proper gear.

774
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,617
MULLEBOGO RESTAURANT

775
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,162
Oh man.

776
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,372
Jeez.

777
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,416
My goodness.

778
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,879
I thought you lived
on a mountain for centuries.

779
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,340
I've realized one thing for sure.

780
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,300
I'd rather die

781
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,553
than live as a human.

782
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,604
It's all cooked,
so you can eat it right away.

783
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:45,564
Enjoy your meal.

784
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,940
- Thank you for the meal.
- Sure.

785
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,582
Gosh, you're spilling everywhere.

786
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,336
You hiked with your legs,
so why are your arms shaking?

787
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,714
How should I know?

788
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,092
There's not one part of my body
that doesn't hurt.

789
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,597
Okay.

790
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,360
Here.

791
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:34,988
Say "ah."

792
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,292
Is it good?

793
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,338
Give me some more.
And some broth too. It's a bit dry.

794
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,011
Here.

795
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,352
Careful, it's hot.

796
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,773
You've got quite an appetite.

797
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,817
You want this?

798
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,735
Yes, the chives too.

799
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,405
- Please come again.
- Thank you.

800
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,830
Are you asleep already?

801
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,623
Jeez.

802
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,924
She must've been really tired.

803
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,629
Man, what on earth am I thinking?

804
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,049
Hey, wake up.

805
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,303
Come on, wake up.

806
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,602
What's this?

807
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,396
Why am I suddenly…

808
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,727
SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY SON SUK

809
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,921
NO TAIL TO TELL

810
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,589
Did you have a weird dream or something?

811
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,967
It wasn't a dream.
It was more like a prophecy…

812
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,679
You seem to keep forgetting,
but you're just a human woman now.

813
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:50,475
I get it. This is like hitting
on a female. It's called flirting.

814
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:51,434
Are you nuts?

815
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,979
Look into the records of the car accident
from nine years ago.

816
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:57,399
Find out everything
about where he lives and what he's doing.

817
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,234
You can't just do this all of a sudden.

818
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,944
How can you do this?

819
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,946
Have you ever seen
any other nine-tailed foxes?

820
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,115
- I have.
- Are you okay?

821
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,574
Do you need help?

822
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,288
Geum-ho?

823
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,708
