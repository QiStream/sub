=The Truth=

01:11.531 --> 01:14.168
=Episode 5=

01:48.940 --> 01:51.541
Chen Yumo, a local from Yunxi City.

01:51.780 --> 01:54.020
Ten years ago, you were gang-raped.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.461
Afterward, your whole family moved away.

01:58.140 --> 02:00.821
Five years later,
your parents died in a car accident,

02:01.341 --> 02:02.860
and you returned to Yunxi.

02:03.372 --> 02:04.780
(Dan Qing/Chen Yumo Profile)

02:04.780 --> 02:06.780
You met Huo at the nightclub.

02:07.341 --> 02:08.940
(Dan Qing/Chen Yumo Profile)
Then you went to the border.

02:10.061 --> 02:11.621
When the rape happened,

02:11.621 --> 02:13.021
you were only 16 years old.

02:15.461 --> 02:16.581
You had a boyfriend.

02:16.581 --> 02:18.861
He was your classmate
at Experimental High School.

02:19.780 --> 02:20.741
His name was Ye Qian.

02:21.461 --> 02:24.341
(And that Ye Qian is now a cop.)

03:03.301 --> 03:04.100
Xiang.

03:07.660 --> 03:08.660
It's our first deal.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.141
Mr. Bao wants to be cautious.

03:11.341 --> 03:12.901
We all understand that.

03:13.301 --> 03:14.660
But if just because

03:15.341 --> 03:16.380
an ex-boyfriend

03:16.940 --> 03:19.672
she barely remembers became a cop

03:20.952 --> 03:22.660
makes you question us,

03:23.820 --> 03:26.700
it makes Mr. Bao's reputation

03:27.500 --> 03:29.220
seem pretty overrated.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.100
You say she doesn't remember her ex?

03:37.341 --> 03:40.220
Then why did he go looking for her
at that hotel you used?

03:42.461 --> 03:43.741
Who says I don't remember him?

03:44.301 --> 03:45.100
I remember him.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.021
I'll remember him till death.

03:50.220 --> 03:52.141
If I hadn't been with him...

03:52.500 --> 03:54.260
Stop beating around the bush.

03:54.741 --> 03:55.660
What do you want?

03:57.301 --> 03:58.660
Prove your sincerity.

03:59.100 --> 03:59.901
Prove she's

04:00.141 --> 04:01.100
not a cop.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.901
Go tell Mr. Bao.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.061
If he doesn't trust me,
we don't have to work together.

04:14.940 --> 04:15.741
This is

04:17.700 --> 04:18.500
unnecessary.

04:23.061 --> 04:24.500
Take Madman with you.

04:42.020 --> 04:42.820
Xiang.

04:45.221 --> 04:46.421
I've got a video here.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.940
- I'd like to share it with you.
- Run? Come back.

04:50.940 --> 04:51.621
Boss.

04:52.181 --> 04:53.020
I know I was wrong.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.020
Please let me go.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.181
You want to die?

04:55.820 --> 04:56.500
Tighter.

04:57.661 --> 04:58.661
Run? Get back here.

04:58.661 --> 04:59.380
Boss!

04:59.820 --> 05:00.661
I know I was wrong.

05:00.661 --> 05:01.781
Please let me go.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.500
Boss, I know I was wrong.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.861
I'll never do it again.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.301
Well done, Dan Qing.

06:15.781 --> 06:16.460
Okay.

06:17.700 --> 06:18.500
Got it.

06:23.301 --> 06:24.460
All four are dead?

06:26.301 --> 06:27.500
You can check for yourself.

06:30.301 --> 06:32.700
They're probably just listed as missing.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.301
As our boss just said,

06:37.741 --> 06:39.781
us meeting like this is fate,
a rare chance.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.221
So how about this?

06:42.421 --> 06:44.700
Let your girlfriend

06:45.020 --> 06:48.020
keep in touch with her ex-boyfriend.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.900
After all, in our line of work,

06:50.541 --> 06:52.421
good relations with the cops can't hurt.

06:56.020 --> 06:56.820
Buried where?

06:57.340 --> 06:58.421
Give me the location.

07:09.741 --> 07:10.541
Xiang.

07:13.421 --> 07:15.221
Send someone unrelated to this location.

07:16.221 --> 07:17.020
Take pictures.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.301
Understood.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.301
Just a moment.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.140
One order of wontons.

07:55.260 --> 07:55.940
Sure.

07:56.181 --> 07:56.940
- Okay.
- No spice.

07:57.240 --> 07:57.940
No chili peppers.

07:57.940 --> 07:58.900
Just a second.

07:58.900 --> 07:59.580
Okay.

08:01.340 --> 08:02.421
Add some greens.

08:02.940 --> 08:03.460
Got it.

08:03.861 --> 08:04.380
Hello?

08:05.061 --> 08:07.181
Where are you with the takeout?

08:07.181 --> 08:07.861
I'm starving.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.020
Bag snatcher!

08:15.221 --> 08:17.541
Move! Get out of the way!

08:31.541 --> 08:32.460
Move!

08:43.021 --> 08:44.061
Looking for trouble, huh?

08:49.620 --> 08:50.340
Stay back!

08:52.421 --> 08:53.301
I'll kill you!

09:04.940 --> 09:05.860
Make way.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.381
Coming through.

09:07.820 --> 09:08.620
What happened?

09:11.580 --> 09:12.661
City CID.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.781
Thanks for your help.

09:13.940 --> 09:14.901
We'll take it from here.

09:16.980 --> 09:17.980
Officers,

09:17.980 --> 09:19.580
they're the ones who snatched my bag.

09:19.781 --> 09:20.980
Alright, come with us.

09:20.980 --> 09:21.620
Take them away.

10:08.376 --> 10:14.488
(Interview Room)

10:40.172 --> 10:43.512
(Ye Qian's Profile)

10:47.061 --> 10:47.860
Dan Qing,

10:48.781 --> 10:49.541
still tailing them?

10:51.340 --> 10:52.021
Yes.

11:43.220 --> 11:44.620
Didn't you grab the keys?

11:50.661 --> 11:52.261
What took you so long?

11:52.261 --> 11:53.781
You could have crawled back by now.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.381
What brings you here?

11:58.661 --> 11:59.740
Quick, come in.

12:00.141 --> 12:01.781
- Where's Little Qian?
- Hotpot delivery?

12:02.061 --> 12:03.421
He went to get the takeout.

12:04.781 --> 12:05.940
If I'd known you were coming,

12:05.940 --> 12:07.340
I wouldn't have told him to go.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.580
Don't flatter yourself.

12:08.580 --> 12:09.620
I am not treating you.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.220
Don't say that.

12:11.421 --> 12:12.740
You've brought so much.

12:12.740 --> 12:14.421
It'd be wasteful
not to finish it, right?

12:15.061 --> 12:16.141
What are you waiting for?

12:16.301 --> 12:17.061
Set it up.

12:17.061 --> 12:17.740
Right away.

12:20.901 --> 12:22.381
Give Little Qian a call.

12:22.381 --> 12:23.261
Ask him where he is.

12:23.261 --> 12:24.381
He's been gone forever.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.460
I won't.

12:25.781 --> 12:28.021
If he knows I'm here,
he'll find an excuse to bolt again.

12:28.181 --> 12:28.740
You call.

12:29.301 --> 12:30.580
I just did.

12:30.580 --> 12:31.700
He didn't answer.

12:32.661 --> 12:33.940
No need to call. He's back.

12:37.141 --> 12:37.940
Dad? Mom?

12:38.261 --> 12:38.980
What a surprise!

12:38.980 --> 12:39.580
Give me that.

12:39.580 --> 12:40.421
Come on in.

12:40.421 --> 12:42.340
Should've told me.
I could've picked you up.

12:42.340 --> 12:43.460
Do we need an appointment?

12:45.781 --> 12:46.552
This is...

12:46.808 --> 12:47.704
Let me introduce you.

12:48.141 --> 12:49.980
This is my good friend, Han Zhao.

12:49.980 --> 12:51.460
And these are my parents.

12:51.860 --> 12:52.820
Hello, ma'am, sir.

12:53.100 --> 12:53.661
Hello.

12:53.781 --> 12:54.541
Long,

12:54.541 --> 12:55.781
where's your roommate?

12:56.181 --> 12:58.021
The tall, slim, fair-skinned one?

12:58.061 --> 12:59.740
He went to get the takeout.

12:59.740 --> 13:00.820
He should be back soon.

13:00.820 --> 13:01.620
Sit down.

13:01.860 --> 13:02.940
Mom, I'll get you a chair.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.501
Sir, have a seat.

13:04.501 --> 13:05.240
Okay.

13:06.261 --> 13:06.980
Long,

13:06.980 --> 13:09.021
how is this place still such a mess?

13:09.301 --> 13:10.940
I need to tidy up for you later.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.061
Please don't tidy up for me.

13:13.061 --> 13:13.940
You did it last time,

13:13.940 --> 13:15.340
and then I couldn't find anything.

13:15.340 --> 13:17.061
Just sit down and enjoy your meal.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.860
Look at you, then look at Ye.

13:19.021 --> 13:20.421
How is he so neat and tidy?

13:20.700 --> 13:21.820
What sauce? Sesame paste?

13:22.620 --> 13:23.501
I'll mix one for you.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.501
Anything's fine.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.141
These foods look so fancy.

13:28.261 --> 13:28.980
I'm so sorry.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.781
We didn't know Long had company.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.220
We wouldn't have come to intrude.

13:34.820 --> 13:35.501
It's fine.

13:35.501 --> 13:37.381
I brought plenty of food.

13:37.620 --> 13:38.820
Let's just eat together.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.781
Han, right?

13:41.700 --> 13:42.580
How old are you?

13:42.860 --> 13:44.061
What do you do?

13:44.381 --> 13:46.261
She owns a restaurant.

13:46.501 --> 13:47.901
A high-end one.

13:49.301 --> 13:51.781
Running a restaurant is no easy job.

13:52.100 --> 13:52.820
It's manageable.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.021
When Long was little,

13:54.021 --> 13:55.501
he wanted to open a restaurant too.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.220
That's quite a coincidence.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.181
Eat.

13:59.781 --> 14:00.740
You have no chopsticks.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.421
I'll get you a pair.

14:08.141 --> 14:09.860
Do your parents misunderstand something?

14:09.860 --> 14:10.860
Clear things up.

14:11.781 --> 14:12.901
Probably not.

14:12.901 --> 14:14.381
Maybe they just think you're pretty.

14:14.901 --> 14:15.940
If they are mistaken,

14:16.860 --> 14:18.381
just deal with it.

14:18.381 --> 14:19.181
I'm totally fine.

14:19.421 --> 14:20.460
I'll hit you.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.141
Just joking.

14:24.381 --> 14:25.021
Here.

14:26.980 --> 14:28.580
Hurry up and text Little Qian.

14:31.980 --> 14:32.580
Ma'am.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.100
Okay.

We're so sorry, Han,

16:24.980 --> 16:26.301
to have you drive us home.

16:26.340 --> 16:26.980
Yeah.

16:27.381 --> 16:28.580
It's fine, sir.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.781
It's just a quick drive.

16:29.781 --> 16:30.781
Don't be polite with me.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.781
Long, don't see us off.

16:32.781 --> 16:33.501
Go back.

16:34.021 --> 16:35.220
I'm already here. Let me.

16:35.381 --> 16:36.141
Alright.

16:36.141 --> 16:37.381
You don't get to visit often.

16:37.661 --> 16:38.940
Rest early. Don't stay up late.

- Bye-bye.
- It's fine.

If it's good,

18:30.180 --> 18:32.180
I can bore the cylinders
and replace the pistons.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.021
We already know

19:30.021 --> 19:31.501
his last known location

19:31.741 --> 19:32.701
was Linshui Township.

19:32.888 --> 19:35.096
Less than 300 kilometers
south of Linshui is the border

19:35.096 --> 19:36.900
between Wannan
and the neighboring province.

19:37.261 --> 19:40.221
Chief Xu is filing a report
with the higher-ups.

19:40.860 --> 19:44.420
Checkpoints are on all major routes
at the provincial border.

19:45.301 --> 19:47.100
Captain Liao is rushing here now.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.380
The roads around Linshui
are very complex.

19:49.461 --> 19:51.140
Manpower and time are both issues.

19:52.021 --> 19:52.900
True.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.580
If we canvass the area
and launch a manhunt,

19:55.580 --> 19:56.820
the efficiency will be low.

19:57.541 --> 19:59.420
If He Changchun senses something

19:59.420 --> 20:00.580
and chooses to flee on foot,

20:00.580 --> 20:02.820
with all the mountains and forests
south of Linshui,

20:03.180 --> 20:04.380
he's a needle in a haystack.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.620
Any news from your friend?

20:08.301 --> 20:09.301
Not yet.

20:31.448 --> 20:34.008
(Manufactured: February 2013)

20:48.340 --> 20:49.981
Yes, I found one.

20:53.781 --> 20:55.420
The ID number is a match.

20:55.501 --> 20:56.180
Go.

20:57.420 --> 20:58.061
You're here.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.580
Here's the auto repair shop address.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.620
Both the engine number and VIN match.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.301
It has those stickers too.

21:04.301 --> 21:05.301
It's that bike.

21:05.981 --> 21:06.781
Thanks.

21:06.860 --> 21:07.941
I'll buy you a meal later.

21:08.580 --> 21:10.820
You guys are working on a Sunday?

21:12.580 --> 21:13.860
Lend me a car, will you?

21:14.100 --> 21:15.301
Doesn't he have one?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.140
That place is far away.

21:18.140 --> 21:19.741
His car would rattle my bones loose.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.100
Sir,

21:38.741 --> 21:40.461
it's been three hours. Is it fixed?

21:41.340 --> 21:41.981
Your...

21:42.900 --> 21:44.620
Your bike is in bad shape.

21:45.301 --> 21:46.701
Can't fix it. Needs parts replaced.

21:47.781 --> 21:48.620
Look,

21:48.941 --> 21:51.781
the piston rings and valve seals.

21:52.620 --> 21:53.660
Both are shot.

21:53.660 --> 21:54.741
I have those here.

21:55.420 --> 21:56.781
But for your crankshaft case,

21:57.461 --> 21:58.660
I don't have one in stock.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.221
J-Just wait a bit.

22:00.221 --> 22:01.261
I'll have one sent over.

22:21.432 --> 22:22.232
From where?

22:23.064 --> 22:23.928
And by whom?

22:25.336 --> 22:27.100
Are there any other auto repair shops

22:29.080 --> 22:30.580
around here besides yours?

22:30.580 --> 22:31.660
Y-Yes.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.061
It's just...

22:33.741 --> 22:35.100
Just a bit further away.

22:35.288 --> 22:36.741
There's one in the next town.

22:37.301 --> 22:38.420
Look, buddy.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.580
W-What are you asking all this for?

22:40.781 --> 22:42.061
Are you fixing it or not?

22:42.461 --> 22:43.981
If you're not getting it fixed,

22:44.461 --> 22:45.781
I'll put it back together.

22:45.981 --> 22:47.860
Just pay the disassembly fee.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.392
(Manufactured: February 2013)

22:57.941 --> 22:58.741
Fix it.

23:02.021 --> 23:02.900
Okay. Wait a moment.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.100
I'll have someone deliver it.

23:04.580 --> 23:06.061
You know, the part is expensive.

23:06.061 --> 23:07.261
D-Don't skip out on the bill.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.221
Hello, Chief Xu.

23:32.340 --> 23:33.541
He Changchun

23:33.541 --> 23:36.021
showed up at an auto repair shop
near Linshui.

23:36.820 --> 23:38.941
Ye and Si Yuanlong
are both heading there.

23:39.820 --> 23:40.741
They're on the way.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.301
How much longer until you arrive?

23:44.021 --> 23:45.180
We're rushing there now.

23:45.180 --> 23:47.224
But with this rain,
we can't drive too fast.

23:47.224 --> 23:48.312
After getting the lead,

23:48.312 --> 23:50.021
we immediately contacted the local CID.

23:50.301 --> 23:51.701
They're on the way to assist.

23:52.741 --> 23:53.261
Okay.

23:54.221 --> 23:55.380
Hurry. As fast as possible.

24:17.356 --> 24:20.120
(Xinbofa Auto Repair)

26:20.941 --> 26:21.541
After him!

26:30.699 --> 26:31.640
(Xinbofa Auto Repair)

27:22.100 --> 27:23.541
Captain Leng, we're at the shop.

27:23.541 --> 27:24.941
He Changchun is driving east.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.701
The owner is out. Get an ambulance.

31:45.301 --> 31:46.100
How's your hand?

31:56.876 --> 31:59.224
(Yunxi Police Department)

32:07.061 --> 32:08.140
Have some water.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.340
Thanks. I was starving.

32:17.340 --> 32:19.660
You're fed and watered?

32:20.860 --> 32:21.580
Let's talk?

32:27.420 --> 32:29.420
This bag is yours, right?

32:33.221 --> 32:34.180
And this knife?

32:35.261 --> 32:35.981
It's mine.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.261
My parents.

32:47.981 --> 32:50.701
Why kill He Hongqing's whole family?

32:54.301 --> 32:55.261
They bullied us.

32:55.461 --> 32:56.420
Explain it in detail.

32:58.420 --> 32:59.061
Okay.

33:00.741 --> 33:01.541
Let me tell you.

33:04.380 --> 33:05.180
That year,

33:05.784 --> 33:06.860
my grandpa was very ill.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.221
He called all his children
to divide the farmland.

33:11.541 --> 33:12.820
- My dad saw his dilemma.
- Little Qian.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.104
He let the others pick first.

33:14.104 --> 33:14.941
I can't open it.

33:14.941 --> 33:16.420
He ended up with the worst plot.

33:17.420 --> 33:19.820
I spent three months
clearing rocks from that land

33:19.820 --> 33:20.856
before planting anything.

33:22.660 --> 33:23.461
The next year,

33:24.100 --> 33:25.221
- during harvest...
- Thanks.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.061
Good thing your tendon wasn't injured.

33:29.221 --> 33:31.420
- Long.
- My uncle, He Shanxiang...

33:31.420 --> 33:32.860
Don't be so reckless next time.

33:33.541 --> 33:35.580
He brought a group to corner my dad

33:36.261 --> 33:37.900
and demanded those five acres back.

33:38.741 --> 33:39.941
They said Grandpa was senile,

33:39.941 --> 33:40.701
so it didn't count.

33:41.580 --> 33:42.541
My dad argued with them,

33:42.541 --> 33:43.701
and they beat him up.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.301
Yet my dad stayed silent
when he came home.

33:49.701 --> 33:51.061
Soon after, he died of anger.

33:52.660 --> 33:53.541
(The irony is,)

33:53.848 --> 33:55.900
(they refused to bury him
in the He family graves.)

33:57.941 --> 33:59.221
I wouldn't stand for it then.

34:00.541 --> 34:01.820
But I still had my mom.

34:03.928 --> 34:06.264
She struggled to keep
the family together and raise me.

34:07.100 --> 34:07.741
But then,

34:08.501 --> 34:10.501
they came to our place
on Chinese New Year's Eve

34:11.021 --> 34:12.740
(and smashed everything they could.)

34:13.780 --> 34:15.220
(Mom fainted on the spot.)

34:15.352 --> 34:17.016
(At the hospital, they found cancer.)

34:20.220 --> 34:21.021
This year,

34:21.740 --> 34:23.740
my uncle's family
joined the village co-op

34:23.740 --> 34:24.821
for land transfers.

34:25.901 --> 34:28.220
They brought a land lease contract
to the hospital

34:28.541 --> 34:30.061
to trick my mom into signing.

34:30.901 --> 34:32.220
They harassed her over and over.

34:32.541 --> 34:34.341
Eventually, my mom
couldn't take it and died.

34:34.541 --> 34:35.580
The doctor said that

34:36.341 --> 34:37.461
had she not been so pressed,

34:37.461 --> 34:40.220
she might've lived another year or two.

34:44.180 --> 34:46.300
I'm the youngest in our generation.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.780
They always bullied me growing up.

34:49.700 --> 34:50.861
I'd run home crying,

34:51.140 --> 34:52.061
and my dad would say,

34:52.541 --> 34:53.660
"They're family."

34:54.260 --> 34:55.180
"They're fond of you

34:55.180 --> 34:56.541
and playing with you."

34:57.981 --> 34:59.861
My dad never fought back.

35:00.901 --> 35:02.140
He endured it his whole life

35:02.421 --> 35:03.620
until he was gone.

35:04.220 --> 35:05.180
My mom endured it too,

35:05.901 --> 35:06.821
and now she's gone too.

35:07.501 --> 35:09.061
Now it's just me left.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.381
I wanted to fight back.

35:13.620 --> 35:14.461
Just this once.

35:17.700 --> 35:18.501
Officer.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.620
Do you think I was wrong?

35:24.740 --> 35:25.780
Of course you were wrong.

35:26.140 --> 35:27.461
Why did you hurt more people?

35:31.660 --> 35:32.620
That traffic cop

35:33.821 --> 35:35.341
suspected the motorcycle wasn't mine.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.021
He pressed me too hard. I had no choice.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.981
The woman at the convenience store

35:41.780 --> 35:42.740
scrolled on her phone.

35:42.941 --> 35:43.901
She saw the news

35:44.341 --> 35:45.341
and recognized me.

35:45.941 --> 35:47.381
And the auto repair shop owner

35:47.381 --> 35:48.421
was calling the police.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.901
So I hurt him.

35:49.901 --> 35:50.780
What about Xu Gang?

35:52.461 --> 35:53.381
Who's Xu Gang?

35:53.381 --> 35:54.381
The motorcycle driver.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.821
You stole his bike

35:57.140 --> 35:58.180
and then killed him.

35:58.780 --> 35:59.700
Remember now?

36:00.461 --> 36:01.541
I didn't know him.

36:02.140 --> 36:03.341
(I didn't mean to kill him.)

36:04.140 --> 36:05.580
(But he fought me desperately)

36:05.580 --> 36:06.541
(over a motorcycle.)

36:07.100 --> 36:08.700
(I panicked a bit.)

36:10.061 --> 36:11.901
(They were like)

36:11.981 --> 36:13.821
(a cornfield blocking my path.)

36:14.580 --> 36:18.700
Whether I snapped them or chopped them,
I had to get through.

36:20.461 --> 36:24.501
You killed He Hongqing's whole family.

36:25.381 --> 36:27.061
Why did you spare the child?

36:31.780 --> 36:32.580
I'm human,

36:33.740 --> 36:34.620
not a monster.

36:37.341 --> 36:38.021
Besides,

36:39.064 --> 36:40.541
that kid hadn't done anything wrong.

36:42.580 --> 36:43.780
After all this,

36:44.981 --> 36:46.981
you think your parents' deaths

36:47.421 --> 36:49.381
were entirely your uncle's fault.

36:50.341 --> 36:51.901
You think killing him was justified.

36:52.501 --> 36:54.260
If we hadn't caught you,

36:55.461 --> 36:56.421
were you going

37:00.780 --> 37:03.180
to let your nephew settle that score

37:04.580 --> 37:05.700
when he grew up?

37:06.620 --> 37:08.300
To turn him into the next you?

37:08.901 --> 37:09.740
As you said,

37:10.180 --> 37:11.580
that kid did nothing wrong.

37:12.180 --> 37:13.421
The adults messed up.

37:14.021 --> 37:16.501
Why make a kid pay the price?

37:17.700 --> 37:20.180
How are you any better than your uncle?

37:20.461 --> 37:21.140
Right.

37:21.901 --> 37:23.461
So I'm confessing everything now

37:25.941 --> 37:26.941
and cooperating fully.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.421
I'm cooperating.

37:30.220 --> 37:31.260
I wasn't trying to run.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.300
My parents lived in that village

37:34.780 --> 37:35.821
most of their lives

37:36.260 --> 37:37.821
but never saw the real sea.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.341
I wanted to take them to see it.

37:41.021 --> 37:42.220
The sea's better,

37:43.260 --> 37:45.461
better than suffering
in the ancestral grave.

37:45.981 --> 37:46.740
Right?

37:52.660 --> 37:54.620
Well? Want some more?

37:55.541 --> 37:56.580
No, I'm full.

37:57.180 --> 37:57.941
That's enough.

37:58.541 --> 38:00.180
We'll talk again next time, okay?

38:01.421 --> 38:02.260
Got it all down?

38:02.260 --> 38:03.021
Yes.

38:03.021 --> 38:03.740
Officer.

38:05.100 --> 38:05.941
Thank you.

38:06.421 --> 38:07.821
I've kept these things bottled up

38:10.740 --> 38:11.700
and never told anyone.

38:21.140 --> 38:23.300
(Your grievances deserved to be heard,)

38:24.061 --> 38:25.100
(but your crimes)

38:25.381 --> 38:26.700
(must face judgment.)

38:38.100 --> 38:39.381
Can I ask a favor?

38:40.140 --> 38:41.541
I didn't make it to the sea.

38:42.941 --> 38:43.821
My parents...

39:19.541 --> 39:20.341
Tired?

39:21.421 --> 39:22.220
No.

39:22.901 --> 39:24.381
Let me drive. You can take a break.

39:25.381 --> 39:26.180
It's fine.

39:28.541 --> 39:30.461
Why'd you say yes to He Changchun?

39:31.780 --> 39:32.901
Didn't think much about it.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.220
Just hoped it might

39:36.981 --> 39:38.100
plant some kindness in him.

39:43.901 --> 39:45.821
Have you contacted
your parents recently?

39:49.981 --> 39:51.821
Filial piety
is the foundation of all virtues.

39:52.300 --> 39:55.341
Call them more often, just to check in.

39:57.780 --> 39:58.461
Okay.

40:00.421 --> 40:01.140
Master,

40:02.740 --> 40:04.341
I have a classmate in the States.

40:04.620 --> 40:06.580
I heard they've developed a new drug

40:06.580 --> 40:07.780
for Alzheimer's.

40:08.341 --> 40:09.541
If you ever need it,

40:09.740 --> 40:10.901
I'll have it brought for you.

40:11.740 --> 40:12.780
Quite expensive, right?

40:14.381 --> 40:16.021
No. It's on me.

40:19.461 --> 40:20.501
How dutiful.

40:43.180 --> 40:45.901
In the end,
we're all just a handful of ashes.

40:46.941 --> 40:48.140
Scattered by the wind.

40:49.580 --> 40:50.780
Cast into the sea,

40:50.780 --> 40:52.220
without a trace left behind.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.700
Why be so stubborn while alive?

40:58.260 --> 40:59.981
We all meet the same end.

41:01.341 --> 41:02.021
Master.

41:03.941 --> 41:05.300
Why make me your apprentice?

41:07.100 --> 41:09.021
Then why did you become a cop?

41:14.341 --> 41:15.660
I know you can't let it go.

41:16.501 --> 41:18.021
And I'm not asking you to.

41:19.061 --> 41:20.140
You're still young.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.260
Life ahead is long.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.421
Don't trap yourself.

41:32.780 --> 41:33.421
Master.

41:36.088 --> 41:37.700
Spend more time with Xiaoyu
when you can.

41:38.140 --> 41:39.021
When he's around,

41:40.660 --> 41:41.780
you're genuinely happy.

41:44.620 --> 41:45.941
A father's faults

41:45.941 --> 41:48.861
are as numerous as the stars.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.021
But his virtues?

41:51.381 --> 41:52.700
Like the sun.

41:53.100 --> 41:54.620
When it rises,

41:54.901 --> 41:57.180
the stars all vanish.
