1
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,961
NO TAIL TO TELL

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,212
Thank you.

3
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,678
Are you asleep already?

4
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,854
She must've been really tired.

5
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,228
Man, what on earth am I thinking?

6
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,440
Hey, wake up.

7
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:47,983
Hey.

8
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:50,944
What's this?

9
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,697
Why am I suddenly…

10
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,018
- You!
- What's wrong with you?

11
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,812
Didn't you say you lost
that wooden-handled dagger yesterday?

12
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:29,066
I didn't lose it. It just wasn't there.

13
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,068
Then why was it in your hand?

14
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,070
What? I told you I don't have it.

15
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,739
I saw it. You just used it to--

16
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,908
Just now? What did I do?

17
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,994
You used it to--

18
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,955
You were dead asleep until a second ago.

19
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,083
Why are you suddenly
rambling about the dagger?

20
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,293
Did you have a weird dream or something?

21
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:49,961
A dream?

22
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,464
I mean, you just woke up
and started talking nonsense.

23
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,258
It wasn't a dream.
It was more like a prophecy…

24
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,636
No, no… wait a second.

25
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,681
I'm not a nine-tailed fox anymore.
I'm just human.

26
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,934
My spiritual power
and abilities are all gone.

27
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,602
And I suddenly see the future?

28
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,937
That's impossible.

29
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,232
So it really was a dream.

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,402
Seriously, what are you doing?

31
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,488
I was scared for a second.

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,282
Maybe it's because
I'm running on fumes.

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,119
What a crappy dream.

34
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,871
What did you dream about anyway?

35
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,667
None of your business.
I don't even want to think about it.

36
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,553
Dream or not, I'm still pissed.

37
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,680
You've got a lot of nerve.

38
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,854
Oh my.

39
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,565
What's her problem?

40
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,363
She's something else.
A real piece of work.

41
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,664
Si-yeol!

42
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,959
Wait for me.

43
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,631
OVERNIGHT WITH THE MOON
GUESTHOUSE

44
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,426
You only have one room left?

45
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,095
Don't be ridiculous.

46
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,974
How could that be?
Who'd even stay in a dump like this?

47
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,186
Only a "dump" like this
would even have a room left.

48
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,688
And you came the night
before the long weekend.

49
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,482
Go somewhere else then.

50
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,276
Please give us a moment.

51
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,569
Come with me.

52
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,281
What is it?

53
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,242
We've been looking for hours,
and this is all there is.

54
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,703
What choice do we have?
Sleep on the street?

55
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,165
Why would I need to?
Instead of this dump,

56
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,042
let's go to a five-star hotel.

57
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,795
Jeez, where would we even get the money?

58
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,547
Let's just stay here for the night.

59
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,216
- No.
- Why not?

60
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,886
It's dirty, cramped, and most of all…

61
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,681
it feels sketchy.

62
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,059
What feels sketchy?

63
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,561
What, me?

64
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,356
What are you even thinking?

65
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,610
You must be joking.

66
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,822
You're centuries older than me.
Give me a break.

67
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,491
- No, it's not that.
- Then what?

68
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,284
It's…

69
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,374
It's just that earlier…

70
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,505
Fine. Let's take it.

71
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,049
I just had a bad dream,
but it's probably nothing.

72
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,551
Let's go.

73
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,889
Seriously, what is wrong with her?

74
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,410
Why did I suddenly have a dream like that?

75
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:15,709
With the way Si-yeol picks on me,
no wonder I'm having dreams like that.

76
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,043
Jeez.

77
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,508
What… is that?

78
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,052
What? This?

79
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,598
What are you going to do with that?
Get back at me or something?

80
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,850
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,979
The owner brought this over
so we could have some fruit.

82
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,527
Oh, really?

83
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:46,948
Oh boy.

84
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
I guess you do have a shred of conscience.

85
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,374
What?

86
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,169
I don't know what you dreamed about,

87
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,298
but it's probably just guilt
over how you treated me.

88
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,799
That's not it.

89
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,093
Sure it is.

90
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,139
See? Guilt always catches up with you.

91
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,186
If it's bothering you,
I guess you really are human after all.

92
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,651
Here.

93
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,032
Could that be it?

94
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,744
Being human is such a hassle.

95
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,083
I've lost my appetite.

96
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,715
Oh my gosh.

97
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,260
Do you really think you're up
for another hike tomorrow?

98
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,137
I don't know.

99
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,313
What is that?

100
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,190
Stay still.

101
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,610
That's part of being human.

102
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,822
You get sore when you use muscles
you don't normally use.

103
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,365
You'll get used to it.

104
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,742
I won't need to.

105
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,829
I'll do whatever it takes
to get my old life back.

106
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,209
Here too.

107
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,086
Don't hold back. Put plenty on.

108
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,802
- Nice and cool, right?
- Yeah.

109
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,262
The soles too.

110
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,849
Not there, you dummy.

111
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,060
OVERNIGHT WITH THE MOON
GUESTHOUSE

112
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,537
Oh my.

113
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,208
You're still up?

114
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,419
I'm so sore I can't sleep.

115
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,097
What are you doing out here at this hour,
looking all pathetic?

116
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,561
I've always wanted to try this.

117
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,439
Just having a beer like this at night.

118
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,734
I won't be able to do this
once I have my life back.

119
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,947
Why not? Just go for it.

120
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,866
Life's short enough as it is.

121
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,579
You know what the human body's like now.

122
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,583
If you just do whatever you feel like,

123
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,711
you'll never get to do
what you really want.

124
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,967
It's just one beer.
What difference does it make?

125
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,468
A big one.

126
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,346
An athlete's body
is like a finely tuned machine.

127
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,975
Everything you eat,
how often and when you eat,

128
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,352
and even your sleep cycle all matter.

129
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,855
It all shows
when you're out there on the field.

130
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,566
You're so dramatic.

131
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,320
Are all other humans like you?

132
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,447
No. That's why I'm the best in the world.

133
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,533
What?

134
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,666
Give me one.

135
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,627
Since I'm human now, I want to get drunk.

136
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,341
Why have you never had a drink before?

137
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,470
Does alcohol weaken
a nine-tailed fox's spiritual power?

138
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,430
As if.

139
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,058
No matter how much I drank,
I just couldn't get drunk.

140
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,413
Have you ever seen
any other nine-tailed foxes?

141
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,840
That must be lonely.

142
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,636
I have.

143
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,932
So I wasn't really lonely.

144
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,185
It was just the two of us for a long time.

145
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,897
- Then where is…
- She died.

146
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,733
After becoming human.

147
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,028
I see.

148
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,204
So this is what getting drunk feels like.

149
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,442
It's a bit cold at night.

150
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:04,075
A fragile human,
still trying to act tough.

151
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,414
You seem to keep forgetting,
but you're just a human woman now.

152
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,383
Oh, I get it.

153
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,887
This is like a human male hitting
on a female. It's called flirting.

154
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,390
Flirt… Are you nuts?

155
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,934
Give it back.

156
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,853
- Give me--
- Hey, no take-backs.

157
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,771
It's nice and warm.

158
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,774
Look, let me be clear.

159
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,068
This is not flirting.

160
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,155
It's called manners, okay?

161
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,325
Don't be shy.

162
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,327
With my looks and charm,

163
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,787
of course you'd fall for me.

164
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,540
I am a nine-tailed fox, after all.

165
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,252
You are unbelievable.

166
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,422
Okay. I'll pretend I didn't notice.

167
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,882
Notice what?

168
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,884
I shouldn't have given you the jacket.

169
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,595
It's so warm.

170
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,312
Do you know the name
of that constellation?

171
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,438
No, what is it?

172
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,148
I'm asking because I don't know.

173
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,941
It's pretty.

174
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:24,113
EPISODE 5
THE CHANGER, THE CHANGED, AND THE LACKING

175
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,291
Woo-seok.

176
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,045
What are you doing up this late?

177
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,341
I just couldn't sleep.

178
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,302
Couldn't sleep? Why?

179
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,891
Because I'm scared.

180
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,187
It feels like when I wake up,

181
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,065
everything will just vanish.

182
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,026
Like a dream.

183
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,945
Like a mirage.

184
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,835
We'd pass as hikers now, right?

185
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,256
Of course. Let's go get stranded.

186
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,116
Why are there so many people here?

187
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,703
The owner said today's the start
of the long weekend.

188
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,746
We won't get stranded
with this many people around.

189
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,875
One small scream,
and people will swarm in to save us.

190
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,084
Coming through.

191
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,212
Seriously.

192
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,047
This isn't going to work.

193
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,925
We need to go somewhere secluded.

194
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,729
Man, I'm dying here.

195
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,147
How much farther?

196
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,440
In my experience,

197
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,401
we'll end up deep in the woods
if we go a little farther.

198
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,820
We can rest there until nightfall.

199
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,427
Are you okay?

200
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,471
What?

201
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,306
Yeah.

202
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,299
I can't take another step.

203
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,303
I think we're officially stranded.

204
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,305
I couldn't find the trail even if I tried.

205
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,663
I'm so sleepy.

206
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,710
You can't sleep out here.
You'll freeze to death.

207
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,254
- Just a little nap.
- Absolutely not.

208
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,923
Hang on.

209
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,345
Try some of this.

210
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,930
It'll wake you up.

211
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,232
Yes, I think it's working.

212
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,817
That's good.

213
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,909
When is she going to show up?

214
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,370
The sun went down ages ago.

215
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,459
Hey, what if…

216
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,629
What if there's no nine-tailed fox here?
What happens to us then?

217
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,256
What?

218
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,008
I mean,

219
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,552
I was just thinking

220
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,305
that the newspaper article
was from 28 years ago.

221
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,308
Maybe she's become a human like you.

222
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,393
No way.

223
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,230
Becoming human isn't that easy.

224
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,484
Considering I didn't even know
there was a nine-tailed fox here,

225
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,861
she can't be more than 300
or 400 years old.

226
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,490
No way she's turned human yet.

227
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,117
Right?

228
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,743
- Yes.
- Yes.

229
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,371
But…

230
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,041
it's freezing.

231
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,710
Yes.

232
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,424
- Should we--
- Should we head back?

233
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,217
- Yeah.
- Okay.

234
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,594
Okay… grab your stuff.

235
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,435
Why do humans have such poor night vision?

236
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,438
I can't see a single thing.

237
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,107
Seriously, where are we?

238
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,700
Oh no.

239
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,245
Can we call those rangers
from yesterday?

240
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,583
I haven't had signal for a while.

241
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,087
Am I really going to die?

242
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,799
Out here? Right after becoming human?

243
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,384
We're not going to die.

244
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,721
I can't die here. I'm Kang Si-yeol.

245
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,437
Si-yeol! Where are you?

246
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,025
Si-yeol!

247
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,236
Si-yeol.

248
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,616
Are you okay? You're not dead, are you?

249
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,453
I'm not dead, but I think I'm done for.

250
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,747
What?

251
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,457
I sprained my ankle.

252
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,798
- Check your phone again.
- Okay.

253
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,096
What?

254
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,306
No!

255
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,783
Do you need help?

256
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,630
Geum-ho?

257
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,812
Is it really you?

258
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,898
How can you be…

259
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,571
All this time, I thought you were dead…

260
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,997
Hey, what's wrong with you?

261
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,459
Do you know me?

262
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,300
What?

263
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,718
How do you know me?

264
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,274
Right. I forget this is what they do.

265
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,818
I was being naive.

266
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,988
You can't be Geum-ho.

267
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,742
She became human and died of old age.

268
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,956
What kind of sick joke is this?

269
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,210
Did I do something wrong?

270
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,883
Are you pretending not to know,
or do you really not know anything?

271
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,347
Just who the hell are you?

272
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,308
Well…

273
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,437
I'm just a fox cultivating myself
in the mountains.

274
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,693
Right. Of course.

275
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,529
This must be the will of Heaven.

276
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,159
And I'm just the fool dancing to the tune.

277
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,704
Hey, where are you going?

278
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,623
Don't follow me!

279
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,584
It's dangerous that way.

280
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,795
That's not a trail humans use.

281
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,173
She said it's dangerous.
What's wrong with you?

282
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,427
I told you not to follow me.

283
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,516
Hey! You--

284
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,477
That little…

285
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,181
Show yourself. I know you're watching!

286
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,310
Come out right now!

287
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:27,026
Stop hiding like a coward and face me!

288
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,448
Why do I have to be human?

289
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,828
And why is a nine-tailed fox that looks
just like Geum-ho showing up now?

290
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,080
Who the hell is she?

291
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,458
What do you want from me?

292
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,428
What are you doing?

293
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,430
I sprained my ankle earlier.

294
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,016
I need to catch up to her fast.

295
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,106
It should feel better now.

296
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,408
Is this fun for you?

297
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,911
Treating me like your toy?

298
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,747
Right.

299
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,751
I bet I'm just a pawn on your chessboard.

300
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:32,174
Setting up all these schemes
and messing with someone's fate

301
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,259
is just how you do things.

302
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:48,649
But you know,
I've got my own way of doing things.

303
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,778
I just ignore everything you say
and do whatever the hell I want.

304
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,488
You already knew that.

305
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,617
I don't know why you turned me human
or what you want from me,

306
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,621
and I don't even know why you sent
someone who looks just like Geum-ho.

307
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,000
But whatever your plan is,
I'm not playing along.

308
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,505
I'll fight back with everything I've got.

309
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,888
Hey!

310
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,642
Hey.

311
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,187
Are you okay?

312
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,647
Yeah.

313
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,235
You scared me. Seriously, you're…

314
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,071
It's cold out.

315
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,909
Hey, you.

316
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,078
Go start a fire or something.

317
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,623
Excuse me?

318
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,055
- Got anything to eat?
- Oh! Just a moment.

319
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,107
What was that about earlier?

320
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,277
Nothing. Just a misunderstanding.

321
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,487
A misunderstanding?

322
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,200
You made a scene like that
over a misunderstanding?

323
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,910
That's right.

324
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,411
Oh, come on.

325
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,247
That was way too dramatic.

326
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,958
If that nine-tailed fox
had a nasty temper like yours,

327
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,960
we'd be dead by now.

328
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,462
What's wrong with my temper?

329
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,924
I'm just saying we're the ones
who need help right now.

330
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,259
Why pick a fight
when we should be sucking up to her?

331
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,803
You're the one
who needs to suck up to her, not me.

332
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,889
And I didn't start the fight.

333
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,391
The ones above are
picking a fight with me.

334
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,019
What are you talking about?

335
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,772
I told you last night.

336
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:56,318
There was another nine-tailed fox
that I lived with for a very long time.

337
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:57,903
And?

338
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,157
That fox is the spitting image of her.

339
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,453
I knew her for centuries,
and yet even I was fooled for a moment.

340
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,541
Right after I become human,

341
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,670
I run into a fox
who looks exactly like her.

342
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:19,049
That's no coincidence.
They must be up to something.

343
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,973
It feels like they're just
openly toying with me,

344
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,975
and it pisses me off.

345
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,687
Well,

346
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,232
let's not overcomplicate things.

347
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,067
Keep it simple.

348
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,654
What? How?

349
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,075
Let's solve my problem first.

350
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:51,790
So even if you're annoyed,
just suck it up and be nice to her.

351
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,876
If she refuses my wish,
are you going to take responsibility?

352
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,170
- You little--
- Hey…

353
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,631
Here, have some of this.

354
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,431
What is this?

355
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,101
This is Fischer's ragwort, that's mugwort,

356
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,395
wild chives, spring cabbage,

357
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,689
coastal hog fennel, shepherd's purse--

358
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,274
That's not what I mean.

359
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,486
You want us to eat this raw?

360
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,323
I washed them in the stream.

361
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,660
Gosh, I guess you're a vegetarian.

362
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,750
Is this what you normally live on?

363
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,126
What are you, a goat?

364
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,879
I'm a fox.

365
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,343
I mean, why would a fox
live on just greens?

366
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,929
Did your mountain god say
you can't self-cultivate if you eat meat?

367
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,434
Not really. I mean, I've lived
on this mountain for so long.

368
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,852
So whenever I try to hunt animals,

369
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,688
it turns out I either know them
or know someone who does.

370
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,982
I can't exactly eat my friend's
great-great-granddaughter.

371
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,525
True.

372
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,654
- What?
- Hey, that's not important.

373
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,616
This is great. So fresh.

374
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,454
You know, I eat a ton of salad too.

375
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,790
Look at that!
We have so much in common.

376
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,042
Please, eat up.

377
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,424
All right, enough.

378
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,843
Stop stalling and tell her why we're here.

379
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,723
Right.

380
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,851
The thing is,

381
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,729
we didn't exactly get lost.

382
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,483
We actually came here looking for you.

383
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,903
Looking for me? Why?

384
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,412
Because I have a wish.

385
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,845
What is this?

386
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,805
What's happening?

387
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,540
You can't just do this all of a sudden.

388
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,167
How can you do this?

389
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,379
HYEON WOO-SEOK, MY STORY

390
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,863
What's happening?

391
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,906
It didn't work.

392
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,992
Excuse me?

393
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,911
I just tried, but it didn't work.

394
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,579
Why didn't it work?

395
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,957
Something was just happening!
Why did it stop?

396
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,127
Well, actually, I--

397
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,837
Just how old are you?

398
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,089
How long have you been a nine-tailed fox?

399
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,426
About 500 years.

400
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,762
Then why can't you pull this off?

401
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,266
I've never done anything like this,
so I didn't even know it was possible.

402
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,769
Well, can't you just
teach her how to do it?

403
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,356
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

404
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,274
She doesn't have enough spiritual power.

405
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,943
It's not about technique.

406
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,112
Come on, that makes no sense.

407
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,323
She healed my ankle just fine.

408
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,742
She was teleporting all over the place!

409
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,577
So why can't she do this?

410
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,290
You can't compare a fate-altering spell
to those cheap party tricks.

411
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,500
Jeez.

412
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,585
Beats me why
a 500-year-old nine-tailed fox

413
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,921
has so little spiritual power.

414
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,550
Well, the thing is--

415
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,011
No… no, this can't be real.

416
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,429
Look.

417
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,349
Just try it one more time. Please.

418
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,977
Maybe it'll work this time.

419
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,311
Well…

420
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,648
It won't matter how many times she tries.

421
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,609
She lacks power. Were you not listening?

422
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,238
Does this not matter to you?
Whose fault is it that I'm in this mess?

423
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,657
Do I look like I'm having fun right now?

424
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,993
I'm in this mess because of you!

425
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,369
You're blaming me?

426
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,328
Obviously.

427
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,248
I should've just let you die back then.

428
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,583
- Hey!
- What?

429
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,626
Please don't fight--

430
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,421
- This is all your fault.
- What?

431
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,549
You're a nine-tailed fox.
How can you be this useless?

432
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,760
Well, actually, I'm not a nine-tailed fox.

433
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,598
What? Come again?

434
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,519
I kept trying to tell you,
but you kept cutting me off.

435
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,523
What? Then what are you?

436
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,527
I'm not a nine-tailed fox.

437
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,654
I'm an eight-tailed fox.

438
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,072
Eight tails.

439
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,203
What?

440
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,881
CALL
SI-YEOL

441
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,637
The person you are calling is unavailable…

442
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,097
What? Why is his phone off?

443
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,813
What the hell is going on?

444
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,571
Five, six, seven,

445
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,074
eight.

446
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,326
There really are only eight.

447
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,578
I should have known.

448
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,790
No wonder she seemed a bit lacking.

449
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,377
What is an eight-tailed fox anyway?

450
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,921
I've never heard of anything like that.

451
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,591
If a nine-tailed fox has nine tails,
what do you think an eight-tailed fox is?

452
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,510
A fox with eight tails.

453
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,054
You know that's not what I meant.

454
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,349
They all start out pretty much the same.

455
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:28,186
Just an ordinary fox
who suddenly starts thinking.

456
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,779
"Why are they human,
while I am nothing but a beast?"

457
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,243
"How can I become something more?"

458
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:49,249
Once a fox reaches that enlightenment
and begins to cultivate themselves,

459
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,961
they start to shed their animal form
and become closer to a human.

460
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,672
For centuries,

461
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,174
as their enlightenment grows,

462
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,720
they gain one tail after another.

463
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:10,270
So, since she's missing a tail,
she's still more beast than human.

464
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,148
She hasn't trained enough
to be a true nine-tailed fox.

465
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,694
How do you know so much about this?

466
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,741
Because I went through it myself.

467
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,454
All that waiting.
All those years of dreaming.

468
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,125
Pardon?

469
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,546
I was a nine-tailed fox
until just a few days ago.

470
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,508
Though now I'm stuck being human.

471
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,678
Wait, so what happens now?

472
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,431
What about me?
Can't I go back to the way I was?

473
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,349
We'll have to find another way.

474
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,768
Since she's clearly--

475
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,270
It's you. The one I've been waiting for.

476
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,773
What?

477
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,109
I've been waiting for you to come.
For over 200 years, sis.

478
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,196
What are you talking about?

479
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,616
The mountain god told me before he left

480
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,701
that someone would come
to take care of me.

481
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,245
You think that's me?

482
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,707
Yes! Though I didn't think
it'd take 200 years.

483
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,085
Still, since you came all this way--

484
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,214
I think you've got the wrong idea.

485
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,882
Please tell me, sis.

486
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,593
How can I become human like you?

487
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,430
What?

488
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,814
I want to become human
as soon as possible.

489
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,670
Wait.

490
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,300
Where did that nice nine-tailed fox go?

491
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,053
Or was it an eight-tailed fox?

492
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:08,930
"Nice nine-tailed fox"?

493
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,599
Then am I the bad nine-tailed fox?

494
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,226
Where did she go, anyway?

495
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,354
Who cares? She probably went on her way.

496
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,232
I'm tired. Let's head back down.

497
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,819
Is it all right to just leave
without saying goodbye?

498
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,114
I mean, isn't she your kin or something?

499
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,700
Why say goodbye
when we won't see each other again?

500
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,078
Are you going to stay and live here?

501
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,415
Okay, fine. Let's go.

502
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,791
Man…

503
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,919
Don't go off alone. It's dangerous.

504
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,129
Hurry up.

505
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,807
Are you changing hotels again today?

506
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,977
Damn it.

507
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,479
Yes.

508
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,899
Today's the chairman's birthday.

509
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,276
Shouldn't you at least attend the dinner?

510
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,572
Forget it.
It's not like anyone wants me there.

511
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,916
Did you look into what I asked for?

512
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,876
Well, Mr. Lee.

513
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,212
Is what you're looking for

514
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,049
the name of some organization?

515
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,760
What the hell are you talking about?

516
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,346
I said, the nine-tailed fox.

517
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,891
You know, the fox with nine tails.

518
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,686
Didn't I tell you to find out everything
about the nine-tailed fox?

519
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,400
Mr. Lee, those things aren't real.

520
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,904
What are you talking about? You saw it.

521
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,948
You were right there with me.

522
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,867
I was?

523
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:58,039
Hey… pull over, you bastard.

524
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,008
Never mind. Just leave.

525
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,011
Mr. Lee--

526
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,263
I said get out.

527
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,641
You probably think I'm crazy too,

528
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,060
and you won't even bother looking into it.

529
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,646
Mr. Lee, if word gets out

530
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,315
that you're looking into such things--

531
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,361
I get it, so please leave
and stop wasting your time on a nutcase.

532
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,702
Hey, wait!

533
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,833
Just… hold on.

534
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,211
Who are you people?

535
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,630
I've seen that bastard somewhere before.

536
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,636
Is he actually dying?

537
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,808
That's it.

538
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,436
I knew he looked familiar.

539
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,396
Secretary Choi.

540
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,650
Look into the records of the car accident
from nine years ago.

541
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,360
Pardon?

542
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,988
The kid I hit with my car.

543
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:17,368
Find out everything about who he is,
where he lives, and what he's doing.

544
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,257
Hey.

545
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,011
Did you have to be so harsh yesterday?

546
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,641
How can I become human like you?

547
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,560
I want to become human
as soon as possible.

548
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,572
Shut your mouth before I shut it for you.

549
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,577
How dare you say that to me
wearing that face?

550
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,331
- But sis--
- Don't call me that.

551
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,584
I don't know who you were waiting for,
but it isn't me.

552
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,587
I have no desire to help you in that way.

553
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,131
But still…

554
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,218
Whatever you choose to do with your life
has nothing to do with me.

555
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,136
So leave me out of it.

556
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,014
I can barely take care of myself as it is.

557
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,059
Do you understand me?

558
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,021
You're not the one I've been missing.

559
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,150
So I don't need to feel
like I owe you anything.

560
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,612
So don't ever show up
in front of me again.

561
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,282
She seemed hurt,

562
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,743
seeing how she left
without a word this morning.

563
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,539
You don't seem
to understand the situation.

564
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,541
We just got played.

565
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,210
We came all this way,
suffered through hell,

566
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,962
and now we're leaving empty-handed.

567
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,257
I guess so, but…

568
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,554
True, who am I to worry?
I'm a mess myself.

569
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,723
So, what's the plan now?

570
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,102
I'm going to go back
and dig through some old texts.

571
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,938
"Old texts"? Like, ancient books?

572
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,400
Yes, there are books on secret methods
for situations like this.

573
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,819
Oh, really now?

574
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,031
You don't remember any
off the top of your head?

575
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,578
How would I remember something
I read centuries ago?

576
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,791
Man, the international break
is coming up soon.

577
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,585
I really need to switch back soon.

578
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,048
Who cares about
some stupid ball game right now?

579
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,509
It is important.

580
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,803
It's an international match.
A game for the national team.

581
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,015
Honestly, aren't you
a Korean nine-tailed fox?

582
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,683
Where's your patriotism?

583
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,898
I've been around longer than Korea has.

584
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:57,236
Look, I don't know if you identify
with Joseon or Goryeo,

585
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,239
but we're still one people.

586
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,913
We are different species.

587
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,081
Don't give me that "one people" crap.

588
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,043
Come on, Ok-sun.

589
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,628
What? I'm not Ok-sun.

590
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,216
But I saw your ID at the police station.

591
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:22,678
- Your name isn't Eun-ho. It's Kim Ok-sun.
- I told you, it's not Kim Ok-sun!

592
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:27,058
- That damn old geezer just put whatever--
- That's just a typical grandma name.

593
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,352
Why be embarrassed about it, Ok-sun?

594
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,438
My grandma's name is Kim Bok-sun.

595
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,818
I'm not embarrassed.
I'm telling you, Ok-sun is…

596
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,574
My name is Eun-ho!

597
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,869
All right, I'll just call you Eun-ho.

598
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,955
- Ok-sun.
- Hey!

599
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,916
Why are you yelling, Ok-sun?
You'll burst my eardrums.

600
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,668
I'm not Ok-sun!

601
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,212
All right, Eun-ho.
I'll call you Eun-ho, okay?

602
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,381
- Ok-sun.
- It's Eun-ho!

603
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:01,509
That damn old geezer, seriously.

604
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,099
What is it, Si-yeol? What's wrong with it?

605
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:10,685
We're out of gas.

606
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,145
So put some in.

607
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:20,111
Look, I was debating whether
to tell you this, but…

608
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,737
What?

609
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,490
My wallet's gone.

610
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,535
- What?
- Listen.

611
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,664
I think it fell out
when I rolled down the mountain.

612
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,793
Then what do we do now?

613
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,314
Hey, here comes one.

614
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,863
What a rude bastard.

615
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:08,367
When I turn back into a nine-tailed fox,
I'll catch him and just…

616
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:13,080
We can't even call the insurance company
since my phone's dead.

617
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,628
Si-yeol, let's just walk.

618
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:20,796
What?

619
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,632
Walk home? Do you know how far that is?

620
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,761
Then are we just going
to stand here like this?

621
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,471
Start walking.

622
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,600
Look, we can't walk there.

623
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,810
Why not?

624
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,646
In the old days,
even frail little scholars

625
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,232
crossed mountains and rivers
to take their exams.

626
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,319
- Aren't you an athlete?
- Jeez.

627
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,739
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about you.

628
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,200
You can't use skills
like earth-folding anymore.

629
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,242
Please.

630
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,497
I've hiked Seoraksan Mountain twice
in this human body.

631
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,541
We must be near Seoul anyway.

632
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,168
It can't be much farther.

633
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,381
I give up.

634
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,389
So, what's your plan going forward?

635
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,016
What do you mean?

636
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,560
You're completely broke right now.

637
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,147
In the human world,
you can't do a single thing without money.

638
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,565
I don't know.

639
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,485
It's not like
I'll be stuck this way forever.

640
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,780
What about dinner tonight? And tomorrow?

641
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,826
- Are you going to let me starve?
- I'm sure there's cash at home.

642
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,203
I can't be completely broke.

643
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,080
Wait a second.

644
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,874
Don't you have a ton of money?

645
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:39,917
What?

646
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,212
Think about how much
you ripped me off just a few days ago.

647
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,673
You couldn't have spent it all already.

648
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,632
I still have it.

649
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,467
There we go then.

650
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,804
Let's just use that for now.

651
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,099
I'll pay you back
once I switch back to my old life.

652
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,394
- But it's at my house.
- Okay, let's go get it.

653
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:03,023
Actually, we can just crash
at your place for a while.

654
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,025
You saw the state of my place.

655
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,027
Yours has to be better than that.

656
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,029
Sorry, but we can't go to my house.

657
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,866
My house is halfway up
Myohyangsan Mountain.

658
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,452
Your house is halfway up a mountain?

659
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,831
Then I guess we'll just grab the cash
and find another place to stay.

660
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,542
I said, it's on Myohyangsan Mountain.

661
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,544
Okay, so what?

662
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,131
Is it really high up?
Higher than Seoraksan Mountain?

663
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,551
Don't you know where
Myohyangsan Mountain is?

664
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,732
GWANGHWAMUN

665
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,454
THE CLEAR WATERS OF BAEKDU

666
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:07,713
North Korea?

667
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,882
Your house is in North Korea?

668
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,300
Yes.

669
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,803
Myohyangsan Mountain is in North Korea?

670
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,056
And your house is hidden up there?

671
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,766
You heard me.

672
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:23,020
Why live there when there are
so many decent mountains around?

673
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,397
I was born there.

674
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,650
Myohyangsan Mountain
has always been my home.

675
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,903
It's humans who put up
barbed wire wherever they pleased.

676
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,363
Why take it out on me?

677
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,782
But you make all your money in the South.

678
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,951
Why didn't you just buy a house in Seoul?

679
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,994
Did you forget I could use earth-folding?

680
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,872
It's a dozen steps from home to Gangnam,
so why would I bother?

681
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,666
You can't be serious!

682
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,295
Seriously.

683
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,172
Isn't there any other way?

684
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,842
Right, what if we ask
that eight-tailed fox from yesterday?

685
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,428
We could just ask her to go get the money.

686
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,140
No one can find that place but me.

687
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,308
I put up a barrier.

688
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,813
A barrier painstakingly made
to evade the eyes of the deities.

689
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,691
You think some dimwitted eight-tailed fox
could get through that?

690
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:09,900
Give me a break.

691
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,236
You're no help at all, ever.

692
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:18,784
Gosh, Si-yeol.
How much longer do we have to walk?

693
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,828
My legs are killing me.

694
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,539
We haven't even been walking
for 30 minutes.

695
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,958
We have another 12 hours to go.

696
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,503
Jeez, this damn human body
is the absolute worst.

697
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,510
What's going on?
Why does it sting so much?

698
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,012
Be careful.

699
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:42,099
Just because it's not summer
doesn't mean you can't get sunburned.

700
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,143
We don't even have money for sunscreen.

701
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,618
Si-yeol, look at this.

702
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,288
Doesn't this work
just as well as sunscreen?

703
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,209
Still, you look ridiculous.

704
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,795
So you're not going to use it?

705
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,591
All right, give it here. I'll hold it.

706
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,181
See? Better than nothing, right?

707
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,474
I guess so.

708
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,812
Anyway, how much longer do we have to go?

709
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:32,149
You just asked.
Now it's 11 hours and 59 minutes.

710
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,413
What…

711
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,835
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
KANG SI-YEOL

712
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,296
This guy…

713
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,300
Is that you, sis?

714
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,097
Is it really you? You came back?

715
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,366
Are we there yet?

716
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,785
Almost.

717
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,540
Good thing we met
a decent human along the way.

718
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,875
I seriously thought I was going to die.

719
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,378
When I get back to normal,

720
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,381
I'll have to bless that human
with a winning lottery ticket.

721
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,384
That's a good idea.

722
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,928
I wonder if he likes soccer.

723
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,473
I was thinking of giving him
tickets to the Champions League final.

724
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,190
I'm hungry.

725
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,533
You know, come to think of it,

726
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:08,495
you must've made connections
with quite a few humans over the years.

727
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,874
People may have forgotten me,
but it's not the same for you.

728
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:13,834
By any chance,

729
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,211
isn't there anyone you can ask for help?

730
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,254
There isn't.

731
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,924
Why not? There must be people
whose wishes you granted.

732
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,593
You said you hand-pick your clients.

733
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,762
Aren't they all as rich as I am?

734
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:28,223
They're rich.
They've got both money and power.

735
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:31,602
So? Let's go ask them for help.

736
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,729
We can pay them back double later.

737
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,151
I've felt this for a while,

738
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:42,362
but for a human, you sure seem clueless
about your own kind.

739
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,281
Like how you blindly trusted your friend.

740
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,326
What are you trying to say now?

741
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,828
I never trust humans.

742
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,372
Especially the ones with money and power.

743
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,375
You know why they grovel
and suck up to me?

744
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,086
It's only because I have power.

745
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,800
If they find out I've lost my power,

746
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,260
they'll try to get back at me somehow.

747
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:11,350
Humans forget favors quickly
but hold on to grudges forever.

748
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,977
Come on, surely not all of them?

749
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,689
There must be some
you're on good terms with.

750
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,651
Do you really think so?

751
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,072
I guess not.

752
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:29,409
You probably bullied them
the same way you did me.

753
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,953
I tamed them.

754
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,330
So they're easier to handle.

755
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:38,752
Anyway, I have to be more careful
with those who know who I am.

756
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,255
So watch your mouth, got it?

757
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,300
That's why you should've been
a little nicer all along.

758
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,136
What?

759
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:50,764
I said I'm hungry.

760
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:53,934
Jeez.

761
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,228
Seriously, what is going on?

762
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,981
Why isn't Si-yeol at home
or picking up his phone?

763
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,816
Tell me about it.

764
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:04,111
How can he borrow a car
and then ghost us for two days?

765
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,905
You don't think something happened
to Si-yeol, do you?

766
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,156
No way.

767
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,992
I'm the one with the problem, damn it.

768
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,952
I've got early morning
deliveries but no car.

769
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:16,582
You can take my car again today.

770
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,917
Your car is so embarrassing to drive.

771
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,086
Everyone stares at it.

772
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,881
Jeong-bae has a nice car.
Why are you embarrassed?

773
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,382
That's why it's embarrassing.

774
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,760
If it were just an expensive car,
I wouldn't be complaining.

775
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:32,222
But who drives a supercar
for an early morning delivery gig?

776
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,600
Plus, the gas mileage just sucks.

777
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:37,352
After paying for gas,
I make basically nothing.

778
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,647
But you know
my baby only takes premium, right?

779
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,442
I know, you jerk. Jeez!

780
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,487
But seriously,
don't you find that car uncomfortable?

781
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,740
What kind of car doesn't have a back seat?

782
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:55,537
Right? It costs a fortune,
but it's only half a car.

783
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,039
It's only got two doors too.

784
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,790
You rich kids…

785
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,334
Hey, take a look at this.

786
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,469
It hit the upper limit twice.
Just look at this stock.

787
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,512
It's going to bottom out,
then bounce back.

788
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,515
Just tell your grandma
to invest a little until then.

789
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,394
Thank you.

790
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:21,813
For now,

791
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,816
let's go inside and get some rest.

792
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,984
- Okay.
- Yeah.

793
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,498
Woo-seok.

794
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,045
I'm sorry.

795
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,339
It took me so long.

796
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,343
Wait, how are you even here?

797
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,513
He probably ran his ass off in a panic.

798
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,518
I see you were together.

799
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,020
Why? Does that make you twice as nervous?

800
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,606
Seeing me next to Si-yeol?

801
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,362
Si-yeol.

802
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,825
I was blinded by greed and crossed a line.

803
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,370
I should've asked you face-to-face.

804
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,457
Honestly,

805
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,711
these past few days felt like a dream.

806
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:32,759
The life I never even dared to dream of
became mine in an instant.

807
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:34,761
- Woo-seok--
- I know.

808
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,180
It's all yours. It's your life.

809
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,224
I know I shouldn't be

810
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,977
doing this to you.

811
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,229
But just for one week.

812
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,983
If a month is too long, how about a week?

813
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,360
Let me play just one
international match next week.

814
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,528
Do whatever you want.

815
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,866
What?

816
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,617
It's not like we'll stay switched forever.

817
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,828
Spending a few days in your life…

818
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,372
wasn't so bad.

819
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,375
I've never had a chance to properly rest.

820
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,169
I'll just think of it as a break.

821
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,506
Really? You mean it?

822
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,885
Let's keep it like this for now.
That way, you won't have any regrets.

823
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,888
But when I say we need to switch,
we switch right away.

824
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,765
You can promise me that, right?

825
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,976
Yes, of course.

826
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,645
Thank you, Si-yeol.

827
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,110
I seriously won't forget this favor.

828
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,656
Sis, I found a way!

829
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,742
It's going to take some time,

830
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,578
but I found a way for you to turn back

831
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,121
into a nine-tailed fox.

832
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,999
Okay, let's talk about it later.

833
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,919
That means he can
go back to his life too, right?

834
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,337
Right?

835
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,628
NO TAIL TO TELL

836
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,088
You found a way?

837
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,965
What if I become a nine-tailed fox?

838
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,175
Then I'll have powers too,

839
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,177
so we can just switch our fates.

840
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,180
I think I should meet this Hyeon Woo-seok.

841
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:45,016
You've invited quite the ghost in.

842
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,227
So there's a chance we can't switch back

843
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,104
if that method doesn't work?

844
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,232
So doing good deeds
builds up spiritual power, right?

845
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,401
But how long will that take?

846
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,945
- Usually, it takes about 100 years.
- A hundred years?

847
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,071
Brace yourself.

848
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,199
We'll be slammed starting tomorrow.

849
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,579
