1
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,961
NO TAIL TO TELL

2
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,466
Fortunately, you have no major injuries.

3
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,386
It's just some minor bruising.

4
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,807
- This way!
- Okay.

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,851
If this had landed just a bit off,

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,562
it could've been much worse.

7
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,188
You really were quite lucky.

8
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,904
Maybe it's because
you were doing a good deed.

9
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,241
I guess Heaven was watching over you.

10
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,201
Right, yes.

11
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,327
But…

12
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,081
they say the universe has no compassion.

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,711
You never know
if you'll be this lucky again.

14
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:28,714
Pardon?

15
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,301
I'm just saying you should be careful.

16
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,636
I see.

17
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,808
Thank you.

18
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,355
Doctor?

19
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,733
What…

20
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,446
What are you doing? My gosh!

21
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,740
I thought you were in here.

22
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,534
No, I'm just coming back from outside.

23
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,662
What? But that man just finished
a checkup with you.

24
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,748
- Si-yeol!
- Where are you going?

25
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,041
Si-yeol!

26
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,170
Si-yeol!

27
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,592
Where is Si-yeol?

28
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,596
You looking for me?

29
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,517
People will think I'm actually dead.

30
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,479
Why are you calling out for me like that?
I'm right here.

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,106
I seriously thought you were dead.

32
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,025
Were you scared?

33
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,321
Eun-ho.

34
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,407
You told me to worry.

35
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,035
You said I should worry about you!

36
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,455
I'm really okay, I swear.

37
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,125
Since when do you actually
listen to what I say?

38
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,473
If you had died,
I would've killed you myself!

39
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,188
You take worrying to a whole new level.

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,483
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

41
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,612
They said I was lucky.
Just a small scratch here.

42
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,365
You really scared me.

43
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,201
You should've been right there
with me when I woke up.

44
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,121
Man, that really hurts.

45
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,997
Where were you?

46
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,042
I was getting the test results.

47
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,460
We're both perfectly fine.

48
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,922
Really? That's a relief.

49
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,301
Let's go.

50
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,804
Where to?

51
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,515
Where do you think? Home.

52
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,819
EPISODE 7
THE REVENGE OF MEMORY

53
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,170
What's with the mood?

54
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,882
This is so awkward. Why is he so quiet?

55
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,039
Oh… it's just that

56
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,959
you had a leaf on your head.

57
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,294
I see.

58
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,171
Okay.

59
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,927
What the hell? What's wrong with me?

60
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,179
Why am I so self-conscious?

61
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,057
He's just a human kid,
still wet behind the ears.

62
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,780
Did you always look like this?

63
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,700
What?

64
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,595
Watch where you're going.

65
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,103
What… was that for?

66
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,273
- There was this bike behind you--
- Si-yeol!

67
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,733
You.

68
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,736
Don't walk so close to me anymore.

69
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,323
- Why?
- Because…

70
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,663
Do I really have to spell it out?

71
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

72
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,251
Well…

73
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,463
That's because…

74
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,090
Hey, check them out.

75
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:32,642
See? We're getting all these looks
because of you.

76
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,479
Are you saying that's because of me?

77
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,564
Of course.

78
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:42,652
I feel bad that you ended up
looking like that after saving me,

79
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,239
but you literally look like a beggar,
minus the tin cup.

80
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,033
A beggar?

81
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,368
Hey, I almost died back there!

82
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,163
I'm saying that's how bad
you look right now,

83
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,999
so don't walk so close to me.

84
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,669
That's not going to make any difference.

85
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,421
What?

86
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:06,509
I'm saying you don't look
any better than I do.

87
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,846
Are you saying I look like that too?

88
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,974
I wasn't the only one in there.
Obviously, you look just as bad as I do.

89
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,976
Oh no.

90
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,645
I barely have any clothes as it is.

91
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,649
I can't exactly walk around downtown
in hiking gear either.

92
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,526
Given how things are,

93
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,613
let's go buy some clothes
before we head home.

94
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,323
- Really?
- Sure.

95
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,617
We don't know
how long we'll be stuck like this,

96
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,285
so you're going to need some clothes.

97
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,453
Right.

98
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,664
I was actually thinking about it anyway.

99
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,123
Then,

100
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,752
can I grab a few other things
while we're there?

101
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,965
- Yeah, sure.
- Great, let's go!

102
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,856
Do you even know
how much all this would cost?

103
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,733
We got your wallet back.

104
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,694
Yeah, but still.

105
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,321
I'm not even sure
about my financial situation.

106
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,199
You said you were buying.
Why are you backing out now?

107
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,369
I meant a few basic T-shirts
and some jeans.

108
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,539
- Not all this high-end stuff--
- Once we're back, we'll both be rich.

109
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,417
Don't be cheap. Just swipe the card.

110
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,460
But…

111
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,346
This feels more like it.
Why was I acting so weird?

112
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,642
He's just the same old Si-yeol.

113
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,541
Silk pajamas? At a time like this?

114
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,210
Just get a tracksuit
you can wear to the store

115
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,171
and around the house.

116
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,757
Don't you know
the importance of sleep quality?

117
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,009
What if I'm too tired
to do anything right?

118
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,179
Don't you want your life back?

119
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,809
You're right.
Sleep quality is very important.

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,402
Can't you just use cheap cucumber soap?

121
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,653
That smells good too.

122
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,281
- What?
- Nothing.

123
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,742
Why am I even bothering?

124
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,578
You bought bath bombs
when we don't even own a tub.

125
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,664
Fine, buy all you want.

126
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,624
There!

127
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,505
- A phone?
- It's a pain not having one.

128
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,632
Mine's still stuck
at Myohyangsan Mountain.

129
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,551
You don't even have anyone to call.

130
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,597
I'm going to be calling you.

131
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,144
Perfect. Let's get this one.

132
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,648
What? You want to buy this?

133
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,651
Why do we need
such a giant TV for that tiny house?

134
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,112
I can't stand small screens.

135
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,323
Haven't you heard?
The bigger the TV, the better.

136
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,202
How can a nine-tailed fox
be so materialistic?

137
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,831
Like you said, who knows
how long we'll be stuck like this?

138
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,040
Just swipe the card.

139
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,970
Excuse me, sir.
It says you have insufficient funds.

140
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,306
See? I told you we're broke.

141
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,226
Let's just get a refund for everything.

142
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,687
Hey. Wait!

143
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,273
Damn it.

144
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,403
Hey, are you crazy?

145
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,487
Unbelievable.

146
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,828
What? Did you say something?

147
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,958
Oh no. Look at that. The tag fell off.

148
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,378
Hello.

149
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,880
HYEON WOO-SEOK SIGNING EVENT
ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD

150
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,966
Thank you. You're so handsome.

151
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,759
- Can I get a photo?
- Sure.

152
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,430
- You're so cool.
- One second, please.

153
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,390
This is for you.

154
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,102
Thank you.

155
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,064
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

156
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,152
Hi. What's your name?

157
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,038
What's this? Why do you carry
something like this around?

158
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,875
Lee Yoon.

159
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,504
My given name is one syllable.

160
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,257
Last name Lee, first name Yoon.

161
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,054
My given name is one syllable.

162
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,056
Last name Lee,

163
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,683
first name Yoon.

164
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,818
You.

165
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,991
So, you remember me?

166
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,786
That was so long ago.
You must have a good memory.

167
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,204
You bastard!

168
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,290
Hey, Woo-seok. Woo-seok!

169
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,000
Whoa… hey!

170
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,671
- Damn it!
- Oh my gosh!

171
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,715
That hurts!

172
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,182
This is more like it.

173
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,810
- Unbelievable.
- Home sweet home.

174
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,979
If you can even call this a home.

175
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,523
How did I get stuck with someone like her?

176
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,901
I only bought the essentials.

177
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:01,322
Seriously, what are we going to do
now that we're out of money?

178
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,949
Do you even have a plan?

179
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,286
We can always make more money.

180
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,579
- Who? You?
- Yes, me.

181
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,833
All you know is soccer.
Do you have any other skills?

182
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,668
Are you serious?

183
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,880
I've lived for centuries.
Do you think I've wasted that time?

184
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,633
I've got plenty of skills.

185
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,886
I'm good at everything I do,
so don't you worry.

186
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,806
Can I really count on you?

187
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,016
Of course.

188
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,852
Ever heard of the term "hobby-rich"?

189
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,938
I've tried every single thing
that looked even remotely fun.

190
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,775
You probably didn't know,
but I even speak English.

191
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,736
Wait, you speak English?

192
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,155
I graduated from Yejeong Academy.

193
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,698
And that's not all.

194
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,410
From woodworking and coffee making
to baking and knitting,

195
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,995
I've learned it all.

196
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,123
Supporting you would be a piece of cake.

197
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,460
I really want to believe you.

198
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,005
But I can't for some reason.

199
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,388
Anyway, even if your fate has changed,
why are you so broke?

200
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,559
It's insane that one shopping trip
emptied your entire account.

201
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,937
Yeah, you're right about that.

202
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,775
I may only be in the fourth division,
but I've still been earning for a while.

203
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,862
It's not like I have a car
or even a nice house.

204
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,991
Do I have a separate
savings account somewhere?

205
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,368
I should look into it.

206
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:33,039
Trust me, squeeze someone hard enough,
and they'll come up with the money.

207
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,207
There's always a way out.

208
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,127
I should just stop talking to you.

209
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,006
Anyway, tell me
what the plan is from here.

210
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,091
What?

211
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,303
Don't tell me you're going to pull
that false kindness stunt again.

212
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,014
What happened this time
was just a total coincidence,

213
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,474
so we got to save those kids.

214
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,060
But we can't rely on flukes like that.

215
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,398
It wasn't a coincidence. It was fate.

216
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,693
I guess the ones above
actually have a conscience.

217
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,154
Seeing how they're finally
cooperating with us.

218
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,408
What are you talking about?

219
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,244
I'm saying everything is going well,
so stop worrying.

220
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,373
How many young lives
did we save today?

221
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,375
It had to be at least ten, right?

222
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,377
Yeah, I guess so.

223
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,506
The merit of saving just one life
is beyond measure.

224
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,677
But saving that many children
with their whole lives ahead of them

225
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,054
on the very first day
we started doing good deeds?

226
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,766
It means Heaven is determined to help us.

227
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,351
You think so?

228
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,061
I'm sure of it.

229
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,148
We must have gained
decades' worth of spiritual power today.

230
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,068
I bet she got the shock of her life
while she was eating her greens

231
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,862
up on the mountain.

232
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,405
I don't think so.

233
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,781
- You scared me!
- Jeez!

234
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,201
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

235
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,207
It's different when it happens to me.
I'll never get used to this.

236
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,171
Next time, knock before you come in.

237
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,048
Don't just pop up out of nowhere, okay?

238
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,217
- Okay.
- Wait.

239
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,262
What do you mean, you don't think so?

240
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,682
Right, I just don't think things
are going very well right now.

241
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,185
And I don't think Heaven
is helping you at all.

242
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,187
What?

243
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,616
We haven't gained
one bit of spiritual power.

244
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,744
That makes no sense.
Are you sure about that?

245
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,750
It's exactly the same as yesterday.

246
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,753
Are you sure you're doing this right?

247
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,964
Why? What's the problem?

248
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,427
I don't know what's going on.

249
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,512
What?

250
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,931
Something's not right.

251
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,683
I don't know why,
but this shouldn't be happening.

252
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,272
What do we do now, Si-yeol?

253
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,950
Man, I can taste blood.

254
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,204
Here.

255
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,792
Are you okay?
Maybe you should go to the hospital.

256
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,252
I'm fine.

257
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,132
Hey, apologize to him right now
before things get worse.

258
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,095
Apologize?
Dad, don't you remember this guy?

259
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,639
Don't you remember
what happened to my life because…

260
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,477
What about your life?

261
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,357
Do you two know each other?

262
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,946
Well, you could say that.

263
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,702
It seems we're more
deeply entangled than I thought.

264
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,455
Seeing how you reacted
to that business card earlier.

265
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,332
I think we should talk in private.

266
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,377
Could you give us a moment?

267
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,672
I really should--

268
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,173
Dad.

269
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,050
Just step outside for a minute.

270
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,154
Jeez.

271
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,323
If looks could kill, man.

272
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,744
You've seen this before, haven't you?

273
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,455
This right here.

274
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,961
Your face tells me everything.

275
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:55,176
But this is just a fake I whipped up.

276
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,596
I was just curious to see your reaction.

277
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,812
What are you trying to say?

278
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:07,938
Just that…

279
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,067
if you're a client
of that nine-tailed fox,

280
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,568
I have a favor to ask.

281
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,071
A favor?

282
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:21,661
You see, I've had
a bit of a misunderstanding with her.

283
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,956
I can't keep avoiding her forever,
so I want to talk things out.

284
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,669
I'd like you to act
as a messenger between us.

285
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,214
Of course, I'll make it worth your while.

286
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,221
Why on earth would I do that?

287
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,058
I want to see your life ruined
more than anyone.

288
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,143
Kang Si-yeol.

289
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,813
He must be a very close friend of yours.

290
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,107
I mean, think about it.

291
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,860
I didn't hit you,
and I didn't ruin your life.

292
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:59,448
And you're still getting this emotional.
Don't you think that's a bit much?

293
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,992
Watch your damn mouth.

294
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,412
You weren't actually doing this for me.

295
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,914
You just couldn't go back?

296
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,546
- Are you afraid I might get in the way?
- You tell me.

297
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,214
I think you're fully capable of that.

298
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,634
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

299
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,515
What are you doing?

300
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,808
This memory…

301
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,227
I found a way!

302
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,729
I don't think it's mine.

303
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,564
Why does this keep happening?

304
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,025
What memory?

305
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,778
You just couldn't go back?

306
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,115
Couldn't go back to what?

307
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,367
Are you afraid I might get in the way?

308
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,245
I might get in the way of something?

309
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,666
Did the nine-tailed fox
mess with your memories?

310
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:53,836
Erase it.

311
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,171
No, wait--

312
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,132
I think so.

313
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,217
Why?

314
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,553
You're the client,
and she erased your memory?

315
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,478
I don't know.

316
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,358
I think I found something out,
and she thought I'd get in the way.

317
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,570
You found something out?

318
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,742
You mean like a weakness?

319
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,243
I don't know. I can't remember!

320
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,828
Okay, I get it. Calm down.

321
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,122
Then, if I help you recover
those memories,

322
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,167
will you tell me
what it was you found out?

323
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:41,884
I happen to know someone
who can help with this.

324
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,471
I'm really curious.

325
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,809
What did you find out that she had to

326
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,269
go as far as erasing your memories?

327
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,787
What if I stay human
and just die of old age?

328
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,832
Why isn't the power building up?

329
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,505
I've been thinking.

330
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,714
Yeah?

331
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,175
Maybe…

332
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,679
…the problem is your attitude.

333
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,557
What?

334
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,600
Think about it.

335
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,561
Going by what you said,

336
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,689
you must do good deeds
to gain spiritual power.

337
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,900
But you tried to wait for someone to jump
so you could save them.

338
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,402
You also tried to start a fire.

339
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,781
That kind of thinking shouldn't be
the basis for doing good deeds.

340
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:55,124
You're starting to sound
just as picky and petty as the ones above,

341
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,626
but this is different.

342
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,421
We saved children
who were in actual danger.

343
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,464
Well, in hindsight, sure.

344
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,593
But I'm saying your mindset
was wrong from the start.

345
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,970
So what's your point?

346
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,475
For starters,

347
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,313
how about we try
doing good deeds by the book?

348
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,190
Do you know how long that will take?

349
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,526
It could take a hundred,
even two hundred years.

350
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,697
Yet you expect me to waste my time
picking up trash in some neighborhood?

351
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,365
That's not what I meant,

352
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,160
but we need to find out for sure

353
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,705
whether doing good deeds
actually builds spiritual power or not

354
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,000
and if you can really
build up that power for her.

355
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,335
Once we confirm that,

356
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,046
then we can find another way,
be it fake or not.

357
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,131
Doesn't that make sense to you?

358
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,258
I guess.

359
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,178
Something undeniable.

360
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,933
Something we can do
sincerely without cutting corners.

361
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,809
You know, that kind of good deed.

362
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,228
Like volunteer work, for example.

363
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,231
Volunteer work?

364
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,402
What would be good?

365
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,866
Right, something like that.

366
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:21,043
FOREVER CARE NURSING HOME

367
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,966
Are you here to do some volunteer work?

368
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,260
What, do you think I'm here
to be looked after?

369
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,429
There's that attitude again. Watch it!

370
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,266
What kind of volunteer work are you--

371
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,144
You know, the hard stuff.

372
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,063
Ideally, something physical.

373
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,440
Hi, it's been a while.

374
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm sorry, do I know you?

375
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,405
Please come this way.

376
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,615
Do you know her?

377
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,201
No, I've never seen her before.

378
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,037
Whatever, let's just go.

379
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,307
It's just cloth, for crying out loud!
How is it so heavy?

380
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,519
Because it's wet.

381
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,979
I know that.

382
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,231
Stop complaining
and put some effort into it.

383
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,151
That's the only way
all this work will mean anything.

384
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,529
Here.

385
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,740
Hey, wait.

386
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,829
So? Do you feel
the spiritual power building up?

387
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,622
I don't know.

388
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:46,211
What if I work myself to the bone
and leave empty-handed again?

389
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,213
Let's just wait and see.

390
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,967
Try to have a better attitude, okay?

391
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,927
I'm trying.

392
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,266
Why are these clothes so uncomfortable?

393
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,728
For how expensive they are,
they're more trouble than they're worth.

394
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,898
It's not the clothes' fault.

395
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,276
Who wears something like that
to a place like this?

396
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,572
It's because
I only have clothes like these.

397
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,367
I have a lot to say about that,

398
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,454
but it won't do any good,
so I'll just keep it to myself.

399
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:42,559
Still, in this day and age,
at least we have these machines.

400
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:46,271
You wouldn't know, but back in the day,

401
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,901
we washed laundry at the creek
and dried it in the sun.

402
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,361
That's how everyone lived.

403
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,114
So many years lived,

404
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,951
yet still so immature, Ms. Kim Ok-sun.

405
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,744
What?

406
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,746
Nothing.

407
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,415
Anyway, you should appreciate
how easy life is now.

408
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,502
If I had to wash and dry these
like the old days,

409
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,213
there's no way
you could've made me do this.

410
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,054
What's wrong all of a sudden?

411
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,283
Talk about terrible timing.

412
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,952
Why did the dryer have to break
today of all days,

413
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,371
when I'm working here?

414
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,707
Better than the washer breaking,
don't you think?

415
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,417
Man, if that had happened,

416
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,794
we'd be in one of those red tubs
like in some drama,

417
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,046
stomping on blankets together.

418
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,262
What, do you want to get in the tub
with me or something?

419
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,346
What?

420
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,725
I thought you were doing that again.
You know, flirting.

421
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,479
Jeez, where do you learn
all this weird stuff?

422
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,732
Stop describing everything as flirting.

423
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,277
No need to be so serious.
Just help me shake out this blanket.

424
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,047
How are those humans
still so into each other

425
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,090
when they're already so old?

426
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,594
They look happy together.

427
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,514
What's it like?
That "dating" thing humans do.

428
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,142
What?

429
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,145
Don't tell me
you've never dated anyone either?

430
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,773
Don't be ridiculous.

431
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,901
I'm Kang Si-yeol.
Do you think that'd even be possible?

432
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,445
I didn't ask who you were.

433
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,447
What I'm wondering is

434
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,201
how someone can love
another person for that long?

435
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,788
No matter how great a human is,

436
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,667
you can always find flaws.

437
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,503
You're also bound to get tired
of each other eventually.

438
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,798
I wouldn't know.

439
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,427
I've never really dated anyone
for that long, actually.

440
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,847
See? I told you humans get boring.

441
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,266
No, that's not it.

442
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,605
You might find this very hard to believe,

443
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,526
but I'm always the one
who gets dumped.

444
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,112
What?

445
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,115
After all that bragging?

446
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,117
Why?

447
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,787
I don't know. It's always the same reason.

448
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,832
They ask how I can
prioritize soccer over them.

449
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,459
But what can I do?
I'm a professional athlete.

450
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,086
Soccer has to come first.

451
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:00,215
Oh, forget it.
I'm the idiot for even asking you.

452
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,107
But you said you've done everything
in the human world.

453
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,651
How come you've never dated?

454
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,820
Because I knew a fox

455
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,865
who totally ruined her life
by falling in love with a human.

456
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,870
I made myself a promise after seeing that.

457
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,789
I'll never love a human,

458
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,791
and I'll never become one.

459
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,003
I vowed to never live like her.

460
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,384
Not that any of that matters.
Look at me now.

461
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,146
Oh, that's cold.

462
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,023
What was that for?

463
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,192
Don't act like it's all over.

464
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,653
I mean, the game isn't over yet.

465
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,156
Even if you're down two goals
in the first half,

466
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,034
you just have to score three
in the second half to win.

467
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,536
We may be struggling right now,

468
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,873
but we'll find a way
and get back to how we were.

469
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,835
I never said we wouldn't.

470
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,589
I'm just saying because you look so down.

471
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,842
Come on.
Let's finish hanging these blankets.

472
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,605
What was that for?

473
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,817
I'm older than you.
Don't try to lecture me.

474
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,194
I'm not lecturing you. Stop it!

475
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,904
- Stop what?
- Stop!

476
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,197
I'm serious!

477
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,076
Hey, you're getting the blankets wet!

478
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,744
So stay right there!

479
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,415
Wait!

480
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,942
Damn, what is…

481
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,695
What's with this place?

482
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,572
Is this really

483
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,450
Jang Do-cheol's house?

484
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,034
Yes, sir.

485
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,580
How can anyone live in a place like this?

486
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,873
This place is creepy.

487
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:44,045
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- This is the last address on record, sir.

488
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,007
He doesn't really leave any traces behind.

489
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,176
What about his number?
Doesn't he have a phone?

490
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,428
No, sir.

491
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,600
Seriously, where the hell is he hiding?

492
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,561
I finally found a lead, and now this.

493
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,067
Hey, wait for me!

494
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,669
Unbelievable.

495
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,882
Does anyone
in the neighborhood know anything?

496
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,759
Well, I asked around.

497
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,553
Apparently, he moved here
about ten years ago

498
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,223
and lived with his family for a while.

499
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,934
Family?

500
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,144
He had a family?

501
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:46,399
Yes, but apparently
not long after they moved in,

502
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,486
his wife and daughter both died.

503
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,779
From what I heard,

504
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,573
they met a horrific end.

505
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,828
Really?

506
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,914
According to the neighbors,

507
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,542
his whole family was cursed

508
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:08,672
because he tried to refuse
the shamanic calling.

509
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,133
Anyway, they said
he's been a bit crazy ever since.

510
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,638
What was that? What is it?

511
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,519
Damn you. Seriously.

512
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,354
Forget that crap.

513
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,606
Just find out where that bastard is.

514
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,775
I need him right now.

515
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,988
- Let's get out of here.
- Mr. Lee.

516
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,117
My goodness! What happened?

517
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,994
I'm sorry.

518
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,205
I told you to dry the laundry,
not soak it all over again.

519
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,374
What am I supposed to do now?

520
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,502
It's sunny out. It'll dry in no time.

521
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,754
- Hey!
- What?

522
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,009
Anyway, good job today.

523
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,303
Go get something to eat. Unbelievable.

524
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,472
Okay. I'm so sorry.

525
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,269
Man, I told you to stop messing around.

526
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
Who told you to hide behind the blankets?

527
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,690
I didn't think
you'd spray water there too.

528
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,359
Whatever. I'm starving, so let's go eat.

529
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,612
Hold on a second.

530
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,505
Have I gone crazy since becoming human?

531
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,553
I thought I was fine.
Why is this happening again?

532
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:43,058
What do you think you're doing?

533
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,893
I can't go eat like this.

534
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,438
There's too much water to just shake off.

535
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,052
Wait, what's with my body?

536
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,053
What?

537
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,014
My body wasn't like this before.

538
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,184
How badly did I take care of myself?

539
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,144
Did I not work out properly?

540
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,147
Why? It looks good.

541
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,150
What?

542
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,151
Nothing.

543
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,863
Just put your shirt back on.
Have some decency.

544
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,616
Wait. Let me just wring out the water.

545
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,326
I said put it back on already!

546
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,371
- What's wrong with you?
- Put it on!

547
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,594
Si-yeol?

548
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,359
What… was he doing?

549
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:20,572
Me? I didn't do anything!

550
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,407
Si-yeol, we're in a nursing home.

551
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,826
Are you crazy?
There are old people everywhere!

552
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,289
I know how this might look,
but it's not like that.

553
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,791
See? I told you to put your shirt back on!

554
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,502
How shameless could you be,
stripping down in public?

555
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,089
Don't you guys get any ideas.
It's not like that!

556
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
Hey, what are you guys looking at?

557
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,984
Come on. Aren't you going to introduce us?

558
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,111
What do you mean?

559
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,493
Fine, whatever.

560
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,619
She's my girlfriend.

561
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,746
What?

562
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,333
What?

563
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,959
How else should I explain it to them?

564
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,295
They barge into my house all the time.

565
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,172
We live together, remember?

566
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,299
- You live together?
- Since when?

567
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,385
I guess it won't be for long anyway.

568
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,888
Pardon? What does that mean?

569
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,598
What won't be for long?

570
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,850
Si-yeol, are you getting married?

571
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,395
What?

572
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,732
Please. Nobody's getting married.

573
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,694
Are you?

574
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,448
Sure, we're getting married too.

575
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,909
That's taking it too far.

576
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,911
That's too far?

577
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,039
- Just eat your food.
- I didn't know.

578
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,708
You jerk. I didn't know you had it in you!

579
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,086
You're the worst, Si-yeol.

580
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,672
Anyway, what are you guys doing here?

581
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,508
What are you talking about?

582
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,552
They're our team's main sponsor.

583
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,888
You know we come here regularly.

584
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,224
As part of our required community service.

585
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,852
- I see.
- But today,

586
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,896
they said someone already did
all the heavy lifting.

587
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,606
So there's not much for us to do.

588
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,733
It just worked out that way.

589
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:24,696
Wait. Was it you
who did all the heavy lifting?

590
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,991
You didn't come to see your grandma?

591
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,994
Grandma? Which grandma?

592
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,830
Your grandmother.

593
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,915
Your own grandmother.

594
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,208
What?

595
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,960
My grandma who passed away?

596
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,218
- What?
- Wait.

597
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,554
Who passed away?

598
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,139
My grandma.

599
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,349
What?

600
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,768
What?

601
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,608
There!

602
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,320
Now, what do we have here?

603
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,323
There we go!

604
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,786
Man, I'm on a roll!
The cards are just going my way.

605
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,581
You're good at this, Coach.

606
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:21,085
I came by to give you some pocket money
since it's been a while,

607
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,254
but my luck just won't let me.

608
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,757
Should I go easy on you?

609
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,593
Now, that wouldn't be right.

610
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,219
- There.
- Look at that!

611
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,098
Let's see.

612
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,644
Here.

613
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,438
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

614
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,863
- Oh my.
- You brat.

615
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,865
Don't just stand there. Come on in.

616
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,701
Grandma?

617
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,912
Look who's here. My grandson.

618
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,216
Go on.

619
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,527
It really is my grandma.

620
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,530
What's wrong?

621
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,574
Did something happen?

622
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,369
Tell me.

623
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,624
Oh my.

624
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,430
Grandma.

625
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,806
There, there.

626
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,506
I don't drink stuff like this.

627
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,842
Just hold on to it then.

628
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,178
I just didn't want to drink alone.

629
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,107
What are you doing, scaring her like that?

630
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,359
I just…

631
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,612
It's just that--

632
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,530
If it's about her nursing home bills…

633
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,994
I kept your name
on the team roster for now.

634
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:05,541
So the team sponsor's hospital discount

635
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,128
should still be good for a while.

636
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,799
Just so you know.

637
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,641
Don't you dare get the wrong idea.

638
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,478
It's not like I'm sitting around
waiting for you to come back.

639
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,355
It's just because of your grandma.

640
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,565
I'm only doing this for her sake.

641
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,444
You're full of surprises.

642
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,740
I thought you hated me

643
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,826
ever since I was young.

644
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,452
I do hate you, you punk.

645
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:45,373
I haven't liked you since you were a kid,
not even a little,

646
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,667
and nothing's changed.

647
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,963
Guess we feel the same way then.

648
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,258
Jeez, this little brat.

649
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,851
This actually tastes good
after all this time.

650
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,280
Grandma.

651
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,409
Is it getting harder for you
to move around?

652
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,871
That's just part of getting old.

653
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,458
It's actually easier here
since they take care of everything for me.

654
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,670
Nothing else is bothering you?

655
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,547
No, I'm fine.

656
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,723
Is something not working out
the way you wanted?

657
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,725
What?

658
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,270
It's okay not to try so hard.

659
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,857
It's not okay, Grandma.

660
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,776
I'm barely scraping by
in the fourth division.

661
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,070
Sometimes life is like that.

662
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,617
Things don't always go
the way you want them to.

663
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,703
You're right.

664
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,999
Life really doesn't go
the way you want it to.

665
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,335
What's wrong now?

666
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:17,089
In my original life and in this one,

667
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,219
I can't seem to give you
the life you deserve.

668
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,889
- Stop that.
- But it's true.

669
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,183
When I had money, you weren't around.

670
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,185
And looking at my life now,

671
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,813
I probably haven't even been able
to take you on a trip abroad.

672
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:36,984
I don't care about any of that.

673
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,948
All the other grandmothers here
are actually envious of me.

674
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,035
Why? What are they envious of?

675
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,665
They're envious because my grandson
is so sweet and visits often.

676
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,501
And besides, I tell them

677
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,296
that my grandson has taken me
to every corner of the country.

678
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,759
When I show them the pictures,
they get so jealous.

679
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,389
I… did that?

680
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,682
Of course.

681
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,893
You took me to see the flowers
when they bloomed,

682
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:14,397
to the water when it got hot,

683
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,317
and to the mountains to see
the vibrant autumn leaves.

684
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,027
Then, when it got cold,

685
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,905
you took me to the hot springs.

686
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,574
Here, look at this.

687
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,453
This was when we went to Yeosu.

688
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,539
MYEONGDONG DAK-GALBI ALLEY

689
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:36,210
And this was when we went to Chuncheon
for some dak-galbi. Goodness.

690
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:40,965
You wandered off,
and I looked everywhere for you.

691
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,552
And this was when we went to Pocheon.

692
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:49,140
You remember the prehistoric site
with the cavemen doing this?

693
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,850
We did that together.

694
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,493
He's a grown man.
Why was he crying like that?

695
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,245
He startled me.

696
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,878
Gosh, you scared me!

697
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,299
- It's you, right?
- What?

698
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,801
It is you.

699
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,554
I know everything.

700
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,766
I know this is all your fault!

701
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,351
What?

702
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:41,108
Die, die, die!

703
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,526
Sir, what are you doing?

704
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,986
Get off me!

705
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,556
I am so sorry.

706
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,892
I'm truly sorry.

707
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,478
Are you all right?

708
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,147
As you can see, I'm not dead.

709
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,149
Though he nearly killed me.

710
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,692
You must've been so scared.

711
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,778
That's not the issue here.

712
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,571
She could've been seriously hurt!

713
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,325
I'm so sorry.

714
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,122
But why did he attack her all of a sudden?

715
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,624
That looks painful.

716
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,918
Sir.

717
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,963
Why on earth did you do that?

718
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,134
What?

719
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:53,055
Me? What did I do?

720
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,766
Never mind.

721
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,352
He's usually such a gentle man.

722
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:03,482
Well, my father-in-law
isn't as stable as he used to be.

723
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,819
He's been showing symptoms
of dementia for a few years.

724
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,654
He doesn't even recognize us.

725
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,614
I see.

726
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:14,034
But nothing like this
has ever happened before.

727
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:15,744
I'm so sorry.

728
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:22,084
I'm Hwang Dong-sik's son.

729
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,588
I'm sorry for being late.
I only just heard the news.

730
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,299
Hwang Dong-sik?

731
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,218
I'm very sorry about my father.

732
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,222
Are you badly hurt?

733
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,768
Your face looks so familiar.

734
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,734
THIRTY YEARS AGO

735
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,329
Hey.

736
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,963
I think I remember now.

737
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,800
You look just like
that old man did back then.

738
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,101
Forget it. You can leave now.

739
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,104
- Still--
- Didn't you come to apologize?

740
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,315
You apologized, and I accepted it.

741
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,399
So we're done.

742
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,361
Si-yeol, I'm tired. Let's go home.

743
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,905
Okay.

744
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,857
Is she okay?

745
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,778
Why is she in such a foul mood?

746
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,706
KANG SI-YEOL'S ACCOUNT

747
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,999
For crying out loud.

748
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,587
I'm flat broke.
Is this really all I have left?

749
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,675
I can barely survive a month with this.

750
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,104
This is so frustrating.

751
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,918
What's that smell?

752
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:23,974
What are you doing?

753
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,268
Oh, hey.

754
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,729
Just wait a bit. It's almost ready.

755
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,700
Why did you get pork shoulder?
I prefer pork belly.

756
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:44,703
Just eat what you're given.

757
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,878
What? Why is this so good?

758
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,922
Is it good?

759
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,550
It's been a while since I cooked,
so I wasn't sure about the taste.

760
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,095
Not bad.

761
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:05,557
Since you had money, I thought
you'd just have people cook for you.

762
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:11,313
You really do have a knack
for backhanded compliments.

763
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:20,948
You've been sighing since yesterday
about having no money.

764
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,449
Why the sudden feast?

765
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,452
Well, I've always wanted to try

766
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,997
grilled meat with soju.

767
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,421
Plus, you seemed a bit down.

768
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,172
Me?

769
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,301
That's right.

770
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,053
Now that you mention it,

771
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,265
I think my mood is actually pretty rotten.

772
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:51,145
Is it related to the ones above again?

773
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,813
Yes.

774
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,616
Man, those guys.

775
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,578
If they have something to say,
they should just say it clearly.

776
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,998
Why are they always sending
such cryptic signals?

777
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,083
Actually,

778
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,420
the message was fairly clear this time.

779
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,756
Really?

780
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,467
What's the message?

781
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,011
That I've lived my life wrong.

782
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,808
I think that old man earlier
was a client of mine.

783
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:30,893
His face looked familiar.

784
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,603
A client?

785
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:37,107
What did you do to him
to make him act like that toward you?

786
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,903
Who knows? I've had plenty
of clients just pass through.

787
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,530
It's not like I remember
every single one of their stories.

788
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:47,201
But I'm sure he has a reason
to hold a grudge against me.

789
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,994
I see.

790
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:54,708
Having been through it myself,
I'm not exactly surprised.

791
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,003
What?

792
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,590
So, is that why you've been
feeling so low?

793
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,136
When I first became human,

794
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,308
I wondered why my reward
for good deeds was a life like this.

795
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:16,939
But I guess this is
just their way of punishing me.

796
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,901
They forced me to become human
when I never wanted to,

797
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,654
shoved past misdeeds
I don't even remember right in my face,

798
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,448
and now they probably want me
to reflect on them.

799
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:34,081
I am sorry about all this.

800
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,250
You're getting punished along with me,

801
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,960
even though I caused this mess.

802
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,631
I don't know about that.

803
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,051
I don't see it that way at all.

804
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,806
What?

805
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,685
The anniversary of my grandma's death
was a few days ago.

806
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,770
I see.

807
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,857
You know,

808
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,779
I always used to say
that I'd spoil her when I made it big.

809
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,909
But she collapsed
during my first season in Europe.

810
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,915
She was all alone,

811
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,751
so by the time she was found,
she was already gone.

812
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,848
When you made this switch happen,

813
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,061
I thought that everything
that was precious and important to me

814
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,523
had vanished.

815
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,110
I was wrong, though.

816
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,197
What I'm saying is…

817
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:54,286
you don't have to feel so sorry for me.

818
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,872
I don't feel like I'm being punished.

819
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,339
We're going to go back
to the way things were anyway.

820
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:10,427
So once all of this is over and behind us,

821
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:14,765
I think I'll remember this moment
like a special dream.

822
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,476
When I think of it like that,

823
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,437
even the bad or uncomfortable parts

824
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,441
feel like a unique vacation.

825
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,071
"A special dream"?

826
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,406
More like a nightmare.

827
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,744
What about you?

828
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:40,207
Was there really nothing good
about becoming human?

829
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,085
What?

830
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,837
Nothing at all?

831
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,642
No, there is something.

832
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:02,104
That's a relief.

833
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,022
What is it?

834
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,027
You.

835
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,705
Maybe it's because I'm human now,

836
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:22,708
but my heart keeps racing
for no reason whenever I look at you.

837
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,295
I guess this is
what humans call romantic feelings.

838
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,507
What?

839
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:36,096
Si-yeol, I think I need to date you.

840
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,915
SPECIAL APPEARANCES
BY JUNG DONG-HWAN AND OH MIN-SEOK

841
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,984
NO TAIL TO TELL

842
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,028
- Open wide.
- What are you doing?

843
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,738
How about a date today?

844
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,574
I think I finally know what we have to do.

845
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,992
Do you want to win?

846
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,495
I'll make sure you move up
to the third division.

847
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,458
- Dad!
- How about it?

848
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,877
Do you remember now?

849
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,963
Where is the chairman right now?

850
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,343
So, fixing the misdeeds
you committed in the past

851
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,469
is the will of Heaven?

852
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:02,057
Does it look like I'm here to negotiate?

853
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,534
