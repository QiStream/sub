1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,225
<i>Methamphetamine. Philopon.</i>

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,269
<i>Street name, meth.</i>

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,647
<i>This wonder drug keeps you awake
and erases fear,</i>

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,525
<i>practically sending you into euphoria.</i>

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,861
<i>It was born during the war.</i>

6
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:34,576
<i>Soldiers high on it charged
into enemy lines without fear,</i>

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,995
<i>and it was used to force</i>

8
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>conscripted laborers
into endless nights of work.</i>

9
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,626
<i>The real problem began after the war.</i>

10
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,089
<i>When liberation came
and men returned home to their families,</i>

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,675
<i>they were no longer the same.</i>

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,517
<i>A boy who had longed to see
his father again</i>

13
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,938
<i>was struck with fear at the sight of a man
he no longer recognized.</i>

14
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>No wonder.</i>

15
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,658
<i>His father had come back as a meth addict.</i>

16
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,621
Stop! Stop it!

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,291
Stop!

18
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,675
Jesus Christ.
What happened here?

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,677
Oh, it's their son.

20
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,971
- That's terrible.
- Good grief.

21
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>The name of the man who got
addicted to meth and killed his wife is</i>

22
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,462
<i>Jang Myeongho.</i>

23
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,297
<i>My father.</i>

24
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,445
Here, have some.

25
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,741
<i>When I was little, my father
would often bring home red bean buns.</i>

26
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,997
<i>I got tired of them
and said I wanted something else.</i>

27
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,250
<i>But he kept bringing red bean buns.</i>

28
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,170
<i>It wasn't until later that I realized</i>

29
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,131
<i>they were my mother's favorite.</i>

30
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,556
<i>He wasn't buying the buns</i>

31
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,893
<i>for me, but for her.</i>

32
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,980
How's your mom?

33
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,983
Is she doing well?

34
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,946
That damn woman.

35
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,866
She's not cheating on me, is she?

36
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,414
Next time,

37
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,459
make sure you bring her.

38
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,046
<i>Ever since he killed my mother,</i>

39
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,924
<i>he has been locked away
in a mental hospital.</i>

40
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,679
<i>Completely unaware of what he did…</i>

41
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,140
<i>he still asks for her.</i>

42
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,989
Hyeeun!

43
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,699
Come here.

44
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,826
Come on, quick.

45
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,744
Your brother's here.

46
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,454
- My brother?
- Yeah, go on.

47
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,374
Come on, people. Pick up the pace!

48
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,293
You want to miss today's quota?

49
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,091
How have you been?

50
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,343
You know, same old.

51
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,096
I guess things will get better with time.

52
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,475
Oh, right.

53
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,394
Are you getting any better at guitar?

54
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,688
Wait, how do you know about that?

55
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,148
How would I know?

56
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,191
You told me about it last time.

57
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,486
Did I?

58
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,030
So, getting better?

59
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,614
No.

60
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,658
Not really.

61
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,205
Why don't you play something?
There's a guitar.

62
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,290
What?

63
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,126
No, I don't want to. It's embarrassing.

64
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,128
What's embarrassing?

65
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,212
Give it a try.

66
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,757
But…

67
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,925
Let's see what you can do on the guitar.

68
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
Even if it's bad, don't make fun of me.

69
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,432
Why would I make fun of you?

70
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:09,118
<i>When sorrows cling to my heart</i>

71
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,583
<i>One by one</i>

72
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,295
<i>Like drops of morning dew</i>

73
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:26,761
<i>More beautiful than pearls</i>

74
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:35,186
<i>On every blade of grass</i>

75
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,316
<i>I climb the hill…</i>

76
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,201
EPISODE 4:
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER

77
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,037
Prosecutor,
your sentencing recommendation.

78
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,499
The defendants, Robert Blunt

79
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,753
and Jimmy Walters,
entered the residence of the victims,

80
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,967
Kim Taeyeong and Lee Suni,
on March 2, 1970,

81
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,970
at approximately 7:30 p.m.

82
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,431
In the course
of demanding methamphetamine,

83
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,559
they brutally murdered the victims.

84
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,061
The knife and other evidence

85
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,564
recovered at the horrific crime scene

86
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,442
clearly establish their intent to kill

87
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,737
during the commission of the offense.

88
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,660
Therefore, in order
to heighten society's vigilance

89
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,413
against the dangers
of narcotics addiction,

90
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,750
the Prosecution submits the defendants
bear full criminal responsibility.

91
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,837
For the defendants,

92
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,423
Robert Blunt

93
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,592
and…

94
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,803
Jimmy Walters,

95
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,223
the Prosecution seeks a death sentence.

96
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,898
How long?

97
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,567
Five? Five years? Ten?

98
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,527
Order in the court!

99
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,243
INDICTMENT

100
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,206
The death penalty?

101
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,790
THE PROSECUTION WALKING
THE STRAIGHT PATH…

102
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,502
I thought you promised
to reduce their sentences!

103
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,088
That's why the Yanks cooperated
with the investigation!

104
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,132
"The Prosecution,

105
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,343
walking the straight path,
upholding principle."

106
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,472
I never promised.
I said I would consider it.

107
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,599
They deserve the death penalty.

108
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,852
The victims were brutally murdered
with slit throats.

109
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,063
And Lee Suni was pregnant.

110
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,065
I know. I get it.

111
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,901
You think
the Americans will just sit back?

112
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,112
- What about US-Korea relations?
- Well…

113
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,573
As I understand it,

114
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,619
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
is paying very close attention to that.

115
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,249
And I heard the US just set up
a federal agency called

116
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,252
the Drug Enforcement Administration
on the president's orders.

117
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,464
So why don't we make
something like that too, sir?

118
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,551
If you recommend it
to the Prosecutor General,

119
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,721
and he raises it with the President,
it could happen.

120
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,348
What have you been up to lately?

121
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,183
Why are you never at your desk?

122
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,811
Well, I'm doing
what I've always been doing, sir.

123
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,437
Yeah, so what is it?

124
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,941
- My job.
- Which is?

125
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,734
Catching criminals.

126
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,028
You know, my job.

127
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,409
If you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.

128
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,035
Hey,

129
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,204
I'm warning you again.

130
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,124
Don't go stirring up the KCIA.

131
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:48,087
Well, as long as they're not
tangled up in drugs,

132
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,214
I have no reason to.

133
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,927
I'll be going now, sir.

134
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
That nutjob.

135
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,226
What about the notebook?

136
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,020
There was no notebook.

137
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,691
No notebook?

138
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,526
No.

139
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,487
She said it never existed
in the first place.

140
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,582
That crazy bitch.

141
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,128
She pulled all that shit
when there wasn't even a notebook?

142
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,881
Right?

143
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,179
You were colluding
with Bae Geumji, weren't you?

144
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,646
That's why you went to Japan with her,

145
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,274
and why you met Choi Yuji?

146
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,865
You plotted it since the time…

147
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,617
…you stopped me
from killing Kang Daeil, right?

148
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,343
Hey. You run a goddamn department
at the KCIA.

149
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,262
And you're pushing drugs?

150
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,814
What will people say if they find out?

151
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,482
You little shit!

152
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,277
Hey.

153
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,571
Did you think I wouldn't know?

154
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,867
You tried to fool me?

155
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,161
How dare you!

156
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,498
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, sir!

157
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,625
Get off me.

158
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,461
Please give me one more chance!

159
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,881
And my life is yours.

160
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,591
You goddamn piece of shit.

161
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,469
How about 200 million?

162
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,014
I'll give you 200 million every month.

163
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,808
You must have an insane death wish.

164
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,892
Hey.

165
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,979
If anyone finds out,
we're both dead, you asshole.

166
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,731
That'll never happen.

167
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,152
Even if something were to go wrong,
we just need to get rid of Kang Daeil.

168
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,113
Sir, it's 200 million every month!

169
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,366
We could make even more down the line!

170
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,871
You don't want to spend your whole life
groveling to Chief Cheon, do you?

171
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,289
What did you just say?

172
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:32,668
I swear I'll do whatever it takes
to put you in the Blue House, sir.

173
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,635
Make it 300 million.

174
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,513
Three hundred million every month.

175
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,558
If you can't do it,

176
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,478
then just die.

177
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,080
You snitched, didn't you?
You fucking bastard!

178
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,667
Hey, what happened, huh?
I didn't snitch.

179
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,127
Come on, man. You scared me.

180
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,296
Look.

181
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,592
Hwang already knew everything, all right?

182
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,261
Jang Geonyoung
from Busan District Prosecutors' Office

183
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,139
showed up and told him
you were tied up with Kang Daeil.

184
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,309
Jang Geonyoung told him?

185
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,436
Yeah.

186
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,771
How the hell does he know?

187
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,105
Beats me, fucker.

188
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,735
Watch yourself, man.

189
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,114
Keep this up,
and you really might end up dead.

190
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,372
Let me meet Cheon Seokjung.

191
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,253
What?

192
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,255
You thought I didn't know?

193
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,635
You're the little rat he planted
to keep tabs on Hwang, aren't you?

194
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,933
How long have you known?

195
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,143
Does it matter how long I've known?

196
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,938
Does Hwang know too?

197
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,022
No.

198
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,152
Why didn't you tell him? You should have.

199
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,197
You could've gone straight to him
and said you found Cheon's mole.

200
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,534
What for? There's no need.

201
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,579
Hey… Oh…

202
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,915
I thought you were just a reckless bastard
with a fucking death wish.

203
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,753
Turns out you're a snake.

204
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,927
Cheon Seokjung.

205
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,305
I have to see him.

206
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,892
I'll pay you back plenty.

207
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,314
Baek Kitae wants to see me?

208
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,524
What for?

209
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,443
He has something to tell you.

210
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,070
<i>How much has Hwang skimmed off?</i>

211
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,031
About a billion, sir.

212
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,200
I see.

213
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,746
I'll think about it and let you know.

214
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,872
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

215
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,345
Na Hoona or Nam Jin?
One, two, three!

216
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
- Na Hoona!
- Nam Jin!

217
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,015
Guess you really are from Gyeongsang-do.

218
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,892
What? No. Gyeongsang-do or Jeolla-do,

219
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,936
when it comes to singing,
Hoona's the best.

220
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,562
Well, I like Jin better.

221
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,481
You silly…

222
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,565
Well, that's good.

223
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,818
You can have Jin. Hoona's mine.

224
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,490
Hey, you think we can just claim them?
Did Hoona ever say he's yours?

225
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,616
Or not. Whatever.

226
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,786
By the way, Soyeong.

227
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,622
Did you really quit your job at the bank?

228
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,124
But why? That's a great job.

229
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,377
Well, you know.

230
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,504
I'm sick of handling other people's money.

231
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,839
So, have you found something new?

232
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,968
No, I'm taking a break.

233
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,679
Your brother didn't say anything?

234
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,349
I mean, others would kill for that job.

235
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,143
Mmm. My brother would never…

236
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,354
Oh, right! Sunyeong.

237
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,357
I have to go. I've got plans.

238
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,525
What plans?

239
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,069
I'm going to see a movie.
The one with Shin Seongil!

240
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,863
Hey, I love Shin Seongil too!

241
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,534
- Can I come? Yeah?
- What? Ah…

242
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,662
What is it?

243
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,998
Wait, is this a date?

244
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,959
Gosh, you catch on fast!

245
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,086
I'll call you later, okay?

246
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,005
Who's the guy? Hey!

247
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,631
Call me!

248
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,265
BOK'S KNITTING SHOP

249
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,593
Soyeong,
I'm going to use the restroom.

250
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,677
Okay.

251
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,738
Hey, Daeil.

252
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,244
It's been a while, huh?

253
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,708
Look at you out on a date.

254
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,838
If Baek Kitae finds out
his little sister's seeing a gangster,

255
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,467
you think he's going to let that slide?

256
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,137
What do you want now?

257
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,100
I did everything
you asked last time, didn't I?

258
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,434
That was then.

259
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,520
There's a new star of the show.

260
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,942
I know the score.

261
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,777
You're moving meth with Baek Kitae, right?

262
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,907
You should make it
to your sister's wedding next month.

263
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,035
And watch her marry
into that teacher's family.

264
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,955
I heard you even bought her a house.

265
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,457
Looks like you made a lot of money

266
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,584
skimming Jo Manjae's meth.

267
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,669
Huh, Daeil?

268
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,346
Call this number
when the first batch is out.

269
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,230
Mr. Jang.

270
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,107
What?

271
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,235
Let me ask you something.

272
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,113
You think you can take on
the KCIA and win?

273
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,324
Want to know what I think? You'll lose.

274
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,868
The KCIA…

275
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,579
They're number one in this country!

276
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,698
You goddamn thug.

277
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,201
Don't screw this up.

278
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,828
Call me when the first batch is out.

279
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,391
Jang Geonyoung,
Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

280
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,976
<i>This is Baek Kitae.</i>

281
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,108
It's been a while. So, what made you call?

282
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,318
<i>Have you had dinner yet?</i>

283
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,403
<i>Not yet.</i>

284
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,322
Good. Would you care to join me?

285
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,992
<i>You mentioned pork and rice soup before.</i>

286
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,536
<i>There's a local spot
called the Miryang House.</i>

287
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,498
The broth there is nice and rich.

288
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,291
<i>Actually,
why don't you come here?</i>

289
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,586
There's a good place
right across from my office.

290
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,714
We can order in
and have a nice, quiet dinner here.

291
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,718
Everyone's gone for the day,
so no need to worry.

292
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,139
All right.
I'll be there by 8:00 p.m.

293
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,729
Here.

294
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,909
This is nice.

295
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,082
So, why did you want to see me?

296
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,585
Well, we said
we'd grab a meal sometime.

297
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,504
I thought I'd make good on it
and also pay my respects properly.

298
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,506
Respects? Come on. By the way…

299
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,927
You've got a certain vibe. You know that?

300
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,513
What do you mean?

301
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,308
Like right now. You're polite.

302
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,392
Too polite.

303
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,394
I'll take that as a compliment.

304
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,355
Compliment? As if.

305
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,983
I'm saying you've got that
KCIA feel, you know?

306
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,277
Gentleman up front,

307
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,488
but savage in the back.

308
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,115
Two-faced, like Janus.

309
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,078
It looks like I've upset you
over Jo Manjae, Mr. Jang.

310
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,996
I'm glad you know!

311
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,875
I hope you don't hold onto it.

312
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,211
Let's clear the air today.

313
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,129
Fine.

314
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,631
So,

315
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,674
did you guys catch Jo Manjae?

316
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,177
He's gone missing.

317
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,764
Missing?

318
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,392
He disappeared.

319
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,978
Well, someone claims they saw him
in the Philippines, but…

320
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,107
He's dead.

321
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,651
Who, Jo Manjae?

322
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,779
Yes. You know,

323
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,199
there was a time this whole city
was flooded with Jo's meth.

324
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,411
It even stirred things up
across the water in Japan.

325
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,123
But the meth's all dried up now.

326
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,792
He suddenly disappeared, you say?

327
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,503
Jo Manjae, the hotshot?

328
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,381
Why?

329
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,550
He must've been killed.

330
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,803
Who killed him?

331
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,987
We'll talk about it next time.

332
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:11,366
So, why'd you join the KCIA, Mr. Baek?

333
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,576
To serve the country.

334
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,455
Serve the country? Oh…

335
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,626
Hey, you want to hear a funny story?

336
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,087
What's the story?

337
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:29,217
I once busted a meth dealer back in Seoul.

338
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,094
And this idiot said his dream was

339
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,055
to export meth to Japan,

340
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,559
earn some foreign currency,
and flood all of Japan with Korean meth.

341
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,479
He said,
"If that's not patriotism, what is?"

342
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,735
You see, patriotism comes in many forms.

343
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,488
That's funny.

344
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,034
Let me tell you another funny story.

345
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,952
Mr. Baek.

346
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,372
I don't care

347
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,166
if it's the KCIA

348
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,668
or whoever pulls their strings.

349
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,129
If you want to take me on,

350
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,423
you'd better be ready.

351
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,969
I don't break easily.

352
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,310
I have no idea what you're talking about.

353
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,229
Mr. Jang.

354
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,982
Man, the timing couldn't be worse.

355
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,694
You know Jang Hyeeun, right?

356
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,239
She works at a dye factory
in Gimpo, Gyeonggi-do.

357
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,243
Apparently, she joined a guitar club,

358
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,622
but we got intel the guitar instructor
has been taking funds from the North.

359
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,961
You'd better tell your sister
to get out of there quickly.

360
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,851
Should I be thanking you?

361
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,436
There's no need.

362
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,815
You and I both work for the government.

363
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,109
We should help one another, shouldn't we?

364
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,448
Your brother graduated top
of his Military Academy class?

365
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,827
But I heard back in high school,

366
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,872
Baek Kihyun got mixed up
in a pretty big incident.

367
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,127
Why bring up my family out of nowhere?

368
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,628
No, it's just,

369
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:34,259
since you were kind enough
to take an interest in mine,

370
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,139
I thought I'd return the favor with yours.

371
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,974
You really want to know?

372
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,270
Not if it puts you on the spot.

373
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,067
Guess it does. Hmm.

374
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,071
Let me throw another one at you then.

375
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,491
That light up there.

376
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,040
And over here!

377
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,377
And this.

378
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,672
Well?

379
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,510
Is this serving the country too? Hmm?

380
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,306
Is the KCIA wiretapping a prosecutor
your idea of serving the country?

381
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,815
Mr. Jang Geonyoung.

382
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,069
This is getting nowhere.

383
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,158
Thanks for dinner.

384
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,913
Mr. Baek Kitae!

385
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,456
You'll see me again! Count on it!

386
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,757
"Serving the country"?

387
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:06,101
<i>Until that day when the waters
Of the East Sea run dry</i>

388
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:11,272
<i>And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>

389
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,242
Pull the wiretap team out
and get the Jang Hyeeun file ready.

390
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,202
Yes, sir.

391
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,999
Did you say Jang Geonyoung's father is
in a mental hospital?

392
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,961
Yes.
A municipal psychiatric hospital in Daegu.

393
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,173
That family has its share of troubles.

394
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,241
How many kilos?

395
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,409
Twenty kilos.

396
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,287
Twenty kilos?

397
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,665
- Is it going to Japan?
- Osaka.

398
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,251
- Who in Osaka?
- Ikeda Yuji.

399
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,003
Ikeda Yuji?

400
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,923
Are you talking about the Ikeda clan
in Osaka? The yakuza?

401
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,509
Baek's delivering it himself?

402
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,093
Yes.

403
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,764
When?

404
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,267
The 13th.

405
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,978
5:00 a.m., Yeongdo.

406
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,523
The 13th.

407
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,902
5:00 a.m., Yeongdo.

408
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,166
The only ship going
from Yeongdo, Busan to Osaka

409
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,709
on the 13th is the <i>Mangeum</i>.

410
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,294
The <i>Mangeum</i>, huh?

411
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,631
But word is, it's actually a KCIA ship.

412
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,345
Those bastards
are really going all in, huh?

413
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,347
Good.

414
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,308
When will it arrive in Osaka?

415
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,810
The next afternoon.

416
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,104
Ms. Oh, you said you speak Japanese?

417
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,898
Yes, I learned it in school.

418
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,234
Book the plane tickets
and hotel rooms right away.

419
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,443
Yes, sir. I will.

420
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,321
Mr. Kim, we don't have much time,
but gather everything you can

421
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,907
on the Ikeda clan,
the one Baek Kitae's dealing with.

422
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,992
Yes, sir. Got it.

423
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,744
All right! We're flying to Osaka.

424
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,873
We'll get there first and tail Baek Kitae.

425
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,708
And sir, here.

426
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,918
That thing you asked about before.

427
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,795
There's nothing special.

428
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,215
He's on leave from SNU's art department,
no history in the student movement.

429
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,300
Clean record.

430
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,093
NAME: KIM MINSU
SEX: MALE, AGE: 29

431
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,679
You said he's
your sister's guitar instructor, right?

432
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,607
So the meth is ready?

433
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,359
Yes, sir.

434
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,194
How many kilos?

435
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,738
Twenty kilos.

436
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,074
Oh… Here.

437
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,083
Kitae.

438
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,418
Yes, sir.

439
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,171
How long have we known each other?

440
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,799
About ten years, sir.

441
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,011
Wow.

442
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,763
Ten years?

443
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,765
Time really flies.

444
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,734
Hey, send Pyo in.

445
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,031
Osaka, did you say?

446
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,741
Yes.

447
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,535
All right. You're going to be
on a tight schedule,

448
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,372
so take care of yourself, yeah?

449
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,291
And while you're there,
pick up a bottle of whiskey.

450
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,212
We'll drink ourselves under the table
when you get back.

451
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,047
Yes, sir.

452
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,515
- Come, have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

453
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,229
Baek's taking the meth to Japan.

454
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,897
You should go with him.

455
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,982
Yes, sir.

456
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,363
- What?
- Nothing, sir.

457
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,241
All right. Cheers.

458
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,034
Have a safe trip.

459
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,420
You can go now.

460
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,467
I'll see you when I get back, sir.

461
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,552
All right.

462
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,315
Any particular reason
you're sending me with him?

463
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,528
He says he's delivering 20 kilos
to Chairman Ikeda.

464
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,280
- Right.
- Keep a close eye on him.

465
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,364
Yes, sir.

466
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,756
<i>Tell Choi Yuji
I want to meet her in private.</i>

467
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes, sir.

468
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,968
Let's get rid of him.

469
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,016
Baek Kitae.

470
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,810
<i>The way he looks at me…</i>

471
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,689
<i>isn't the same anymore.</i>

472
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,778
<i>Take care of him</i>

473
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,530
on the ship back to Korea.

474
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,449
Yes, sir.

475
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,166
<i>The way he looks at me…</i>

476
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,711
<i>isn't the same anymore.</i>

477
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,716
<i>Take care of him…</i>

478
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,303
<i>on the ship back to Korea.</i>

479
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,872
OSAKA, JAPAN

480
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,001
Here is
last month's balance sheet, Father.

481
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,299
I believe you'll be pleased,

482
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,095
but if it falls short, please guide me.

483
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,764
I hear Kimura

484
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:47,395
and the other executives
have been talking.

485
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,939
You've heard already?

486
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,235
You know it's hard to keep
the factories running in Japan now.

487
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,320
Korea's our only option now.

488
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,781
The quality of the sample is solid too.

489
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,536
It may still be too soon.

490
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,748
Don't you trust me, Father?

491
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,841
Yeah,
you had that same look in your eyes…

492
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,887
the first time I saw you.

493
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,722
Still,

494
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,226
you seemed too good to be serving others.

495
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,353
And I'm always grateful to you.

496
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,815
If so, keep your head on straight.

497
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,529
Unless you want to go back to that life.

498
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,951
You need to earn their trust

499
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,621
with your own ability,

500
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,749
not because you're my daughter.

501
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,960
If you can't get things done
without me stepping in,

502
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,883
there's no reason to put you out front.

503
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,969
Yes, sir.

504
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,556
I'll make sure
you have nothing to worry about.

505
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,561
That'd be good.

506
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,191
I do think of you as my own.

507
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,736
But for the sake of the clan,

508
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,363
sometimes

509
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,034
one must spill their own child's blood…

510
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,041
Are you all right?

511
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,834
Should I call Dr. Miura?

512
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,930
A bath. Just draw me a bath.

513
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,726
Yes, sir.

514
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,939
HOTEL FUKI

515
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,235
The budget's a little tight.

516
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:04,073
But I didn't know
it was this kind of place.

517
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,335
Excuse me…

518
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,171
I booked two rooms.

519
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,590
It says it's one room.

520
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,759
- That can't be.
- What's wrong?

521
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,597
She says only one room is booked.

522
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,641
I clearly booked two.

523
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,685
Just ask for one more room then.

524
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,769
Okay.

525
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,190
Well… we'd like one more room, please.

526
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,151
I'm very sorry.

527
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,864
With the Osaka Expo going on,
we have no vacancies.

528
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,657
Expo?

529
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,534
Expo?

530
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,618
Expo.

531
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,246
She says there's no room.

532
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,331
Man…

533
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,672
Oh, boy.

534
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,900
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Jang?</i>

535
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,693
Yeah. Go ahead.

536
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,029
<i>Sir, Baek Kitae just left on the ship.</i>

537
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,114
Really?

538
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,949
<i>But some guy got on with him.</i>

539
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,659
Okay, got it.

540
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,411
<i>Yeah.</i>

541
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,037
Wait. Listen.

542
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,497
- <i>Wait…</i>
- Don't hang up yet.

543
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,581
Let's talk a little more.

544
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,333
<i>I'm hearing some kind of noise.</i>

545
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,335
- Noise?
<i>- Are you doing something?</i>

546
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,878
No, what would I be doing?

547
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,213
<i>I hear some weird…</i>

548
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,133
What do you… Gosh,
that's enough. I'm hanging up now.

549
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,135
<i>Okay. Good night, sir.</i>

550
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,219
Was that Mr. Kim?

551
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,473
Yeah.

552
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,269
He said Baek Kitae left on the ship,

553
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,729
but he wasn't alone.

554
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,731
Who's with him?

555
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,694
We don't know.

556
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,407
THE MANGEUM

557
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,694
Boss!

558
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,374
Boss.

559
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,586
Hurry it up!

560
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,426
Boss!

561
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,970
Boss!

562
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,972
- Back to work!
- Yes, sir!

563
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,142
It may look like just a fish market,

564
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:05,856
but this one distribution network delivers
meth to every dinner table across Japan.

565
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,093
Boss.

566
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,761
I'm hungry.
Want to go grab a bite to eat?

567
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,056
How about a drink?
We closed the deal on good terms.

568
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:26,353
If you don't mind, there's somewhere
I'd like to go with Mr. Baek alone.

569
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,865
Go.

570
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,785
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

571
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,800
- Boss!
- Boss!

572
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:07,603
KOREATOWN, OSAKA

573
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,917
I thought you were hungry.

574
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,001
What are we doing here?

575
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,920
This is where I grew up.

576
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,715
My lifelong goal was to get out of here,

577
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,093
but I could never forget the food.

578
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,303
- The hibiscus flower's bloomed!
- Got you! Run!

579
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,846
Run!

580
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,307
DON'T BE FOOLED BY PROPAGANDA!

581
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,436
Actually, I grew up here too.

582
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,696
Nice broth.

583
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,367
When did you move to Japan?

584
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,120
When I was little,
about nine years old.

585
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,329
What about you?

586
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,289
I was born here.

587
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,711
We might've crossed paths here back then.

588
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:19,591
Come to think of it,
I think I remember seeing you.

589
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,928
When did you go back to Korea?

590
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,180
When I was 19,
after my father passed away.

591
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,391
We moved to Busan, my mother's hometown.

592
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,727
The next year, my mother passed too.

593
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,396
So, I was busy providing
for my younger siblings.

594
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,607
Must've been rough.

595
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,235
Family, right?

596
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,405
Can't win with or without them.

597
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,703
I thought
I'd at least stop hearing "<i>Chosenjin</i>".

598
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,331
But instead,
I got called "Jap" all the time.

599
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,877
So sick of it.

600
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,799
The food was great. I'll see you again.

601
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,718
Thank you.

602
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,057
I need a partner
who can produce

603
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,809
much larger volumes on a steady basis.

604
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,730
Right now, you're still small-time
in this business.

605
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,359
I can't help but doubt
how much you can actually put out.

606
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,114
How much exactly do you want?

607
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,200
Ten times the amount now.

608
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,994
- That would cover all of Japan--
- That's right.

609
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,956
I need enough supply
to swallow up all of Japan in one go.

610
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:37,586
That's the only way
I'll have the power to crush

611
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,798
that greedy old man once and for all.

612
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,302
I shut down our factory
on the outskirts of Osaka not long ago.

613
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,430
It had a stock
of the finest Taiwanese precursors.

614
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,850
With that, you'll have more than enough
to hit the quota I gave you.

615
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,520
You're saying
you'll hand me the raw material?

616
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,563
At what price?

617
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,690
Don't worry.
I'll consider it an investment.

618
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,445
But make sure you secure a steady pipeline
of precursors from Taiwan soon.

619
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,199
I can't keep covering for you every time.

620
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,243
I never asked you to.

621
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:14,248
You're right.
Maybe I just want to see you.

622
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,252
Are you coming on to me?

623
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,225
<i>Sir, the deal went through smoothly.</i>

624
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,603
And did you talk to Choi Yuji?

625
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,146
<i>Yes, sir. I did.</i>

626
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,774
When are you coming back?

627
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,651
<i>We'll be on our way now.</i>

628
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,113
Take good care of Baek Kitae.

629
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,698
<i>Yes, sir. I will.</i>

630
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,955
HWANG GUKPYEONG, KCIA

631
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,353
How much is that?

632
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,648
Comes out to about 300 million won.

633
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,067
I see.

634
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,571
You can buy 100 apartments with that.

635
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,533
Name your price.

636
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,557
PORT OF BUSAN, KOREA

637
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,860
Man, if Pyo Haksu is in on it too,

638
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,113
that means the KCIA is running meth
on an organized scale.

639
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,784
At this point,
Hwang must be in on it too, right?

640
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,285
I guess so.

641
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,249
- Here they come.
- They're coming out.

642
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,334
They're coming out.

643
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,671
- That's Pyo Haksu. He's out.
- All right, get ready.

644
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,714
- Get ready.
- Hey, get ready.

645
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,799
Get ready.

646
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,259
Wait. But I don't see Baek Kitae.
Baek's not here.

647
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,888
Oh? Baek Kitae's not here.

648
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,391
Wait, hold position.

649
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,809
Hold position.

650
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:39,893
Hold position.

651
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,938
Stay sharp and stand by.

652
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,358
- Car! Incoming!
- Get down!

653
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,531
Damn, that scared me.

654
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,367
Isn't that Director Hwang's car?

655
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,451
Yes, it is.

656
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,912
- What's he doing here?
- What's going on?

657
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,707
- The cash?
- In the bags, sir.

658
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,377
- Nice work.
- Yes, sir.

659
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,883
Wait,
but Baek Kitae hasn't come out yet.

660
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,677
Where is he?

661
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,804
- Why isn't that bastard coming out?
- Damn it.

662
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,225
What? They're turning around.

663
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,269
- Wait. Why are they leaving?
- They're leaving.

664
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,438
- They're coming! Down!
- What about Baek Kitae?

665
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,399
- Hide! They're coming! Down!
- Why are they leaving without him?

666
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,321
They left.

667
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,534
But Baek Kitae's…
Sir, what do we do?

668
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,618
Baek…

669
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,412
Okay. Well…

670
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,040
Stay hidden and watch the <i>Mangeum</i> closely.

671
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,709
Make sure you see if Baek Geum…
Baek… Baek Kitae gets off!

672
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:48,712
What about Baek Kitae?

673
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,590
All taken care of, sir.

674
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,593
Geez.

675
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,306
And what did Choi Yuji say?

676
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,977
We had a good talk.
She said she'd get in touch with us soon.

677
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,356
- Take down Kang Daeil and seize the gang.
- Yes, sir.

678
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,400
And run the factory yourself.

679
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,568
Yes, sir. Understood.

680
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,989
Kitae, you fool.

681
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,130
What happened with Baek Kitae?

682
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,595
<i>He hasn't gotten off the ship yet.</i>

683
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,224
Listen, you can't lose him!
Watch closely!

684
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,227
<i>Sir, Baek Kitae…</i>

685
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,562
What?

686
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,648
Baek Kitae, what?

687
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,440
Oh, no.

688
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,734
Hey, hey, hey!

689
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,782
Hey, what the heck? What's happening?

690
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,650
Stop!

691
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,155
What the hell is this?

692
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,827
They had to raise hell
with a goddamn ritual today of all days?

693
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,788
Give me.

694
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,291
- Wait here.
- Yes, sir.

695
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,345
- Did Baek Kitae…
- Yes?

696
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,139
…say anything to you?

697
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,143
He just groveled and begged for his life.

698
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,568
I'll be here, sir.

699
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:51,997
God, those bastards.

700
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,332
Where the hell did they go?

701
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,711
Damn it.

702
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,041
There.

703
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,781
Stop!

704
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,949
Oh, dear.

705
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,285
Stop!

706
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,431
What the hell?

707
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,857
Sunja!

708
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,029
You can't do this!

709
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,301
Fucking bastards.

710
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,486
What the hell is going on here?

711
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,322
You!

712
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,740
What the hell are you doing?

713
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,909
Stop fighting!

714
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,078
Wait, hey! Stop them!

715
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,621
Come on, stop them!

716
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,253
- You goddamn vermin.
- Wait, wait…

717
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:51,217
THE HALL OF ULTIMATE BLISS

718
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,257
Hey! You!

719
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,229
Kitae.

720
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,049
Ms. Oh, start searching outside!

721
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,615
Director Hwang.

722
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,492
What happened here?

723
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,135
Ambulance.

724
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,220
Ambulance!

725
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,280
The phone!

726
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,240
Where's the phone?

727
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,856
Hello? This is Jang Geonyoung
from Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

728
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,484
I'm in Bansong, Haeundae.

729
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,987
Someone's in critical condition here,
so send an ambulance right now.

730
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:43,116
I'm here in Bansong… It's… A temple!

731
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,450
I'm at a temple!

732
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,661
The name of the temple?
I don't know! What?

733
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:50,415
There are five temples in this area?
Then send an ambulance

734
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,749
- to all five!
- Fire!

735
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,292
- Fire!
- Fire!

736
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,003
- Call the fire department!
- Fire!

737
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,464
- What the hell?
- Fire!

738
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,718
Fire! Fire! Fire!

739
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,052
Watch out!

740
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,472
Water. Oh, water.

741
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,020
Okay. All right, move! Move out!

742
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,198
Okay, okay.

743
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,285
Oh, no! Stay back! It's dangerous!

744
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,657
