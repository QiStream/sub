(Bowang)

4
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,300
Excuse me.

5
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,539
Where is the table reserved by Miss Han?

6
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,339
Sir.

7
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:28,060
Second floor.

8
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,739
Thank you.

9
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:29,500
No problem.

10
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:37,739
Little Zhao.

11
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,339
Where should I sit?

12
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,979
- Next to her.
- Next to him.

13
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,179
I'll sit there.

14
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,780
Next to Little Zhao.

15
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,379
Off duty now, let's have a drink.

16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
No alcohol. I might get called in.

17
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:01,020
Alright.

18
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,899
You guys are killjoys.

19
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,660
Then I'll drink by myself.

20
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,459
Yu.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,660
One pot of spirit and two colas.

22
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,420
- Okay.
- Spirit?

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,540
You're really something.

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,260
I'll open it for you.

25
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:21,459
I'm not drinking.

26
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,380
I'll have water.

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,659
I'll have it.

28
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,980
I'll have it.

29
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,659
Did you tell Little Qian

30
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:37,659
that you're pursuing me?

31
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:39,619
No.

32
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,619
What for?

33
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,820
You know I like Little Qian.

34
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,179
I know you like Little Qian.

35
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,459
But Little Qian doesn't like you.

36
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,260
You're single, and I'm single.

37
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,659
So I can pursue you.

38
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,140
Don't need his permission, but yours.

39
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,339
I haven't agreed.

40
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,260
I know you haven't.

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,380
That's why I'm pursuing you.

42
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,659
Fine.

43
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,659
You're paying today.

44
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:01,899
No problem.

45
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,860
This place isn't cheap.

46
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,860
Officer, can your salary cover this?

47
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,020
Don't worry. I've got Qian here.

48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,619
She owns this place.

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,059
I opened this place for him.

50
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,659
Try this.

51
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:35,540
This.

52
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,820
This is way too much.

53
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,659
Not at all.

54
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,939
You need nutrients. Eat more.

55
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,659
All are your favorites.

56
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:44,980
Just this once.

57
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,260
Don't do this again.

58
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,540
Too much to finish.

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,059
You eat too.

60
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:51,540
Got it.

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,580
Next time, let's eat at my place.

62
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:55,540
Your place?

63
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,179
I opened a restaurant nearby.

64
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,420
You know the ropes.

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,980
Come try the food sometime.

66
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,260
Why open a restaurant suddenly?

67
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:09,059
You cops are busy,

68
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,219
but you still need to eat.

69
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,939
If you eat at my restaurant,

70
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:12,939
I won't charge you.

71
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,740
Actually, I wanted

72
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,859
you to come eat often,

73
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:24,979
then we'd see each other more.

74
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,580
Han Zhao, I've told you.

75
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,500
It won't work.

76
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,580
Why not?

77
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,580
We're both single and available.

78
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,140
And I've got this.

79
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,539
I support you

80
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,180
to open a restaurant.

81
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,659
But if you say it's for me,

82
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:47,659
I won't accept it.

83
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,979
Got it.

84
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,459
Enough talk, just eat.

85
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,180
Quit rambling.

86
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,700
Eat this. Your favorite.

87
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,820
You eat too.

88
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:03,899
If you say so,

89
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:05,859
I won't come again.

90
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,979
Well...

91
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,180
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

92
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,979
Why only love Little Qian?

93
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,899
You're not his type.

94
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,060
Do you know his type?

95
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,979
Of course, I do.

96
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,380
He likes long-haired,

97
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,459
gentle,

98
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,620
simple,

99
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,859
and delicate girls.

100
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,260
You're not that type.

101
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,140
You told him about Chen Yumo?

102
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:40,899
This way.

103
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,820
Mr. Pang, you're here.
The room your booked is upstairs.

104
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,419
This way.

105
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:47,020
Thank you.

106
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:49,779
Please, this way.

107
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,459
What would you like to eat?

108
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,779
Salt-baked mackerel pike.

109
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,500
Thank you.

110
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:05,219
Pretty woman?

111
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:07,659
Do you know her?

112
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,859
Colleagues.

113
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,140
Same department with us.

114
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,620
I really underestimated
you police officers.

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,620
Your spending level is quite high.

116
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,899
I think Ziwu

117
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,219
is here for another blind date.

118
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,260
Blind date?

119
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:24,700
That guy comes here often.

120
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,219
He brings a different woman each time.

121
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,260
I often

122
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,299
come to this place,

123
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,339
so I booked here.

124
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,979
The environment is nice.

125
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,820
Take a look at the menu.

126
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,099
If you don't like it here,

127
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,539
we can change another place.

128
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:46,620
No need.

129
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,099
Anything will do.

130
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,539
Alright.

131
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:50,979
Let's eat first.

132
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:51,859
By the way,

133
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,140
I booked a KTV room.

134
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
After dinner, we can go sing songs.

135
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,580
Mr. Pang.

136
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,740
I need to explain something to you.

137
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:03,539
Actually, I'm not interested

138
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,979
in this blind date today.

139
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,099
The reason I came

140
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,339
is that I didn't want
to embarrass Mr. Zhao.

141
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,260
After today's meal,

142
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,140
I think

143
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,899
we won't meet again.

144
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,539
So let's split

145
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,099
the meal cost.

146
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,620
It's okay.

147
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,140
Take a look at the menu and order food.

148
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,380
I need to use the restroom.

149
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,580
Sir, what would you like to order?

150
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:35,419
It's okay.

151
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:36,380
I'll go to the restroom.

152
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,060
I'll take a leak.

153
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,260
I'll go too.

154
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,940
Wait,

155
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,459
you two don't go to the same restroom.

156
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,072
Well...

157
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:51,539
Hello.

158
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,140
Having a blind date.

159
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,539
(Restroom)
A police, over thirty.

160
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,979
I don't know why my mom knew her.

161
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,299
Hello.

162
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,659
Hello.

163
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:06,779
But honestly,

164
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,940
I probably won't

165
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,539
get much benefit from this woman.

166
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,219
I did some digging before I came.

167
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,500
With her level and position,

168
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,219
she can earn

169
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,260
ten thousand yuan at most per month.

170
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,620
What's the use?

171
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,940
To put it harshly,

172
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,820
if she were frontline,

173
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,099
died in service,

174
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,140
I could get a compensation
of hundreds of thousands.

175
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,099
Really.

176
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,939
Just a woman without feminine charm,
no fun at all.

177
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:38,936
(Restroom)

178
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,779
Who did it?

179
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,220
Who beat me?

180
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,500
Where are you?

181
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Don't dare to admit it?

182
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,376
What happened?

183
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:52,980
Where were you?

184
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,819
Who's in charge?

185
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:54,539
Took so long.

186
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,779
No one leaves
until I get an explanation.

187
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,500
Who's in charge?

188
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,299
Call him over,

189
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:01,659
or I'll call the police. Hurry up.

190
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,620
Where's the person in charge?

191
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,460
Call him over. Who hit me?

192
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,340
Get me the surveillance footage now.

193
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:14,380
Hurry up.

194
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,179
Is this your car?

195
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,179
My friend's.

196
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,340
Sorry for causing trouble.

197
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,100
Thank your friend for me.

198
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,659
It's okay.

199
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,620
I've seen the girl who had dinner

200
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,380
with you today.

201
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:48,620
Where?

202
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,419
When you first came to the department.

203
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,539
Right at the entrance.

204
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,860
I remember it quite clearly.

205
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,299
I remember she had

206
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,740
a Japanese lunchbox wrapped in cloth

207
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,860
in her hand.

208
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,899
We grew up together.

209
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,299
I can tell that girl really likes you.

210
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,059
Ziwu.

211
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,179
We're just friends.

212
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,419
I wish she thought the same way.

213
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,460
I forgot to warn that scum

214
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,760
to stay away from my restaurant.

215
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,140
After what you did,

216
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,460
he'd never dare come.

217
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,380
I bet he won't even come near

218
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,220
the area.

219
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,260
But anyway,

220
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,699
you shouldn't have beaten him.

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,899
Didn't you hear what Little Qian said?

222
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,299
He's trying to exploit women.

223
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,220
Not a chance.

224
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,740
And I turned off the cameras

225
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,460
near the restroom.

226
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,100
Smart move!

227
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:58,779
He has no idea who beat him.

228
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,620
You didn't see the face of Little Qian.

229
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:03,100
If I hadn't hit him first,

230
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,340
he would've done it instead.

231
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:05,740
Right.

232
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,220
Has he been like this?

233
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,059
So violent?

234
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,500
Of course not!

235
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,699
Little Qian has always been

236
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
good at learning

237
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,260
and gentle.

238
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,899
He can cook

239
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,260
and paint well.

240
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:25,819
He was a track and field star.

241
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,579
Total heartthrob!

242
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,740
Really?

243
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:33,819
Cross my heart.

244
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:35,899
Let me tell you.

245
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,340
Many people
had crushes on him back then.

246
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,419
(There was a long line of admirers!)

247
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,819
Little Qian.

248
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,699
(If we were taking numbers,)

249
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,059
(I'd be first in line.)

250
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,899
Little Qian, fight for it!

251
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,380
(But he only had eyes for Chen Yumo.)

252
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,419
Because of Chen Yumo,

253
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,460
he fell out with his parents

254
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,299
and went to police academy,

255
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:05,860
becoming a police.

256
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,980
The most dangerous kind,
criminal police.

257
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,179
After all these years,

258
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:13,020
he'd chase any lead

259
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,779
about Chen Yumo

260
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,659
until he confirmed it was false.

261
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,899
It's been ten years.

262
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,939
You know he doesn't like you.

263
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:24,179
Doesn't that hurt you?

264
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,620
It hurts, of course.

265
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,220
But I'm willing to wait.

266
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,500
I'm still young, right?

267
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,100
For someone I love,

268
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,899
I'll take the chance.

269
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,059
I'll grab more drinks.

270
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:58,360
One.

271
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,260
Already back?

272
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,860
What are you doing?

273
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,659
Little Zhao

274
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,460
rides motorcycles and runs a restaurant.

275
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,419
Where else could I find
such an amazing girl?

276
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,899
I've decided.

277
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,220
I need to earn more money.

278
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:31,620
One meal cost me half a month's salary.

279
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,299
That won't do.

280
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:33,220
Can't keep this up.

281
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,579
Where are you going?

282
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,380
Are you sneaking off to see Little Zhao?

283
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:42,779
Go on!

284
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:47,299
I'll focus on earning money.

285
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,340
Work hard. Earn big.

286
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:03,896
(At the department or at home?)

287
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:09,944
(Zhang Ziwu:
At the department or at home?)

288
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:19,260
Ziwu.

289
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,980
Lei.

290
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,699
Little Qian's parents
are overseas, right?

291
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,140
I've never heard him call them

292
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,419
once in the dorm.

293
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,620
What a distant family.

294
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,740
But he and Captain Leng...

295
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,620
Honestly, they're kind of similar.

296
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,220
Men of few words, workaholics,

297
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,340
avoid relationships.

298
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:41,939
Talking to them

299
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,419
is like pulling teeth sometimes.

300
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,620
Can't figure out
what Little Zhao sees in him.

301
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,020
He's handsome!

302
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,380
Little Zhao?

303
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,340
The girl from that restaurant?

304
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,059
How do you know?

305
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,020
She's really into Ye Qian.

306
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,179
Don't get your hopes up.

307
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,620
Something's going on.

308
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,020
Hurry. Tell me!

309
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,100
What is there to tell?

310
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,500
Not promising?

311
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,899
Unrequited love.

312
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,020
How tough.

313
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:22,443
(Shancheng Community, North Gate)

314
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:40,152
(Eternal Love)

315
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:04,024
(China Railway High-speed)

316
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,020
I've booked the room.

317
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,339
I'll pick him up tomorrow noon.

318
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,220
Okay. I'll transfer you the room fee
via WeChat this afternoon.

319
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:16,420
No need.

320
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,539
He hasn't finished his homework.

321
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,180
It's in the bag.
Tell him to do it, okay?

322
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,940
Xiaoyu, be good, okay?

323
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,260
I will pick you up tomorrow noon.

324
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,819
Alright.

325
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:24,819
I'm leaving.

326
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,460
Where do you want to go?

327
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,059
Let's go eat.

328
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,440
What do you want to eat?

329
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:34,260
Anything.

330
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:57,260
Where's Master?

331
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,660
He took leave.

332
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,180
He took leave?

333
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,059
Where did he go?

334
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,980
He went to Shanghai.

335
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,940
Well, could you give this to him for me?

336
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,619
Thanks.

337
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:35,480
(Theater Entrance)

338
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,980
Are you a child?

339
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,980
No.

340
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,740
Is this fun?

341
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,859
Yes.

342
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:44,299
Why are you alone?

343
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,619
Where's Little Qian?

344
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,220
Something holds him up,
so he won't come.

345
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Why didn't you tell me?

346
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,980
If I'd tell you, you wouldn't have come.

347
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:51,619
Take it.

348
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:52,500
What for?

349
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:53,379
I'm leaving.

350
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:55,660
Wait. You're already here.

351
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,660
We can just watch it together.

352
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,099
About that motorcycle case,
I've wanted to thank you.

353
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,099
You thank me?

354
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,500
Little Qian should be
the one thanking me.

355
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,819
With our relationship,
it doesn't really matter.

356
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,700
It took you a whole month
to recall that?

357
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,579
I've been remembering it.

358
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,020
But my actions got hindered.

359
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,700
Look at my hand.

360
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,579
I'm like a fortune cat.

361
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,740
I can barely manage to eat.

362
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,900
You can barely manage to eat.

363
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,700
But you send me selfies every day.

364
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,180
You fortune cat!

365
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:27,379
You thank me by inviting me to a movie,

366
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:28,900
and I bought the tickets?

367
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,099
After the movie,
I'll treat you to dinner.

368
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:31,980
Not a big deal.

369
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,619
Relax. I'm shopping with my mom.

370
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,579
I'll tell her now.

371
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,700
Since when did I become your mom?

372
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,500
Last time, you sent
Little Qian dumplings.

373
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,059
I lied to him

374
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,500
that my mom made them.

375
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,779
And you told me he accepted them

376
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:55,859
and really enjoyed them?

377
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,619
He did accept them and eat them.

378
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:58,819
And he enjoyed them.

379
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,299
Si Yuanlong.

380
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,660
Can you stop telling lies?

381
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,180
Can I trust you to handle things?

382
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:05,819
Yes! Of course.

383
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:06,539
Absolutely.

384
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,500
Are you wearing Little Qian's jacket?

385
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:12,779
He gave them to me.

386
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,500
How is it?

387
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,660
Do I look better than him wearing it?

388
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,299
W-Well...

389
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:18,260
Talk about that later.

390
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,980
Let's go watch it.

391
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:06,680
(Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

392
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:07,896
(Zhang Ziwu: Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

393
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:31,896
(Leng Qiming: Just had a meal with him.
He's doing homework now.)

394
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:34,648
(Zhang Ziwu: Have you seen Xiaoyu?)

395
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:42,840
(Leng Qiming: Just had a meal with him.
He's doing homework now.)

396
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:48,472
(Zhang Ziwu: Talk to him more.
Don't just stare at him.)

397
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,020
Got a lot of homework?

398
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
It's manageable.

399
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,379
I've been swamped lately.

400
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:03,619
Well...

401
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:04,339
I know.

402
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,220
Call me if anything's wrong.

403
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,299
Nothing's wrong.

404
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,859
How are you and your mom

405
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,180
getting used to things over there?

406
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,619
Dad, I'm doing homework.

407
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,500
Want ice cream?

408
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
Chocolate.

409
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,139
Okay.

410
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:35,220
I'll buy it.

411

(Loyalty, Justice, Service, Dedication)

412
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,579
Ye.

413
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:53,980
- Chief Xu.
- Where's your master?

414
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,420
Went to Shanghai.

415
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,339
Shanghai?

416
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:58,980
To see his son?

417
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:00,740
Call him.

418
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,579
Ask him to come back.

419
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:02,940
Okay.

420
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,339
Don't eat this often.

421
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:15,059
Too fatty.

422
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,619
I've paid for the room.

423
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
I'll send you the money.

424
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,260
- Don't bother.
- Let's go.

425
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,700
Be a good boy.

426
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:29,819
Let's go.

427
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:31,379
Bye, Dad.

428
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:33,700
How have you been?

429
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,740
Had a nice time?

430
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,740
Have you missed me?

431
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:39,220
Did you bring me a gift?

432
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,579
Of course.

433
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,299
(Adopt With Love, Take Me Home)
How could I forget that?

434
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,859
You guys are doing a charity event?

435
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,740
Have water.

436
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,260
Thank you.

437
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,059
How strong

438
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:00,740
the sunshine is.

439
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:01,539
Thanks.

440
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,220
Let's see. What kind of dogs are these?

441
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,339
So cute.

442
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,099
Have some water.

443
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,180
- Hello, this is Jiao Lei.
- Here you go.

444
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
What kind of dogs?

445
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,859
Okay, I'll be there.

446
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:10,819
Are they strays?

447
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,960

00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,980
I've got a mission.

450
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,099
I have to go.

451
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,859
What do you mean?

452
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,059
You insisted on watching.

453
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:39,859
Now you want to leave me here
all by myself?

454
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,099
I'm really sorry.

455
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:42,420
That's just how my job is.

456

Please forgive me.

457
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:45,500
I owe you a meal.

458
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,619
Aren't you off today?

459
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,579
You're not leaving.

460
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:51,779
I'm going.

461
00:25:58,579 --> 00:25:59,339
Everyone's here?

462
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,779
Three days ago,

463
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:09,220
within Beicheng County's jurisdiction,

464
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,460
a homicide occurred.

465
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,339
The victim, Wang Xiaole,
lived in Apartment 402,

466
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,299
Building 10 of Shancheng Community,

467
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
got murdered in her home.

468
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,420
Beicheng CID requested assistance
from city police department.

469
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,339
And after deliberation
by city police department leadership,

470
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:27,700
our department and the forensic unit

471
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,859
are assigned to assist.

472
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,539
These two are from Beicheng CID.

473
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:33,379
Let them brief us on the case.

474
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,139
Just call me Sun.

475
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:36,020
I'm Zhou.

(Loyalty, Justice, Service, Dedication)

477
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,020
Captain Sun, it's all copied.

478
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,020
Good. I'll brief everyone.

479
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:43,579
(Photos of Wang Xiaole)
The victim is Wang Xiaole,

480
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:44,740
33 years old,

481
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,579
a teacher at the Yunxi Health School.

482
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,139
Her parents reported the case.

483
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,420
According to her dad,

484
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:55,660
around 9 PM on the night of the murder,

485
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,660
he sent her a message.

486
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,099
But he waited until the next morning

487
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,139
and still got no reply.

488
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,660
So he and his wife got anxious

489
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,700
and went straight to her home.

This is the victim, Wang Xiaole.

Long, that outfit
looks pretty sharp today.

497
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,379
Double-check it.

498
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:32,700
Okay.

499
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,688
Are you crazy?
Why are you wearing my jacket?

500
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:41,059
You gave it to me.

501
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,539
Why can't I wear my own jacket?

502
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,664
When did I give it to you?

503
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:46,420
That day we had hotpot.

504
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:00,260
You threw such a nice jacket away?

505
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,379
Quit the nonsense.

506
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,379
I threw this jacket away,

507
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:06,579
not gave it to you.

508
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:07,619
(Police)
You did throw it away.

509
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,420
But I asked you

510
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,339
to give it to me if you didn't want it.

511
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:11,500
I asked you several times.

512
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,339
I thought you were joking.

513
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:15,819
Joking?

514
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:18,059
Why would I joke about a nice jacket?

515
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:21,020
It just had some frays.

516
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,339
I fixed them and it's all good.
Throwing it away is such a waste. Look.

517
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:26,980
Alright.

518
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,020
Then don't wear it when I do.

519
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:32,740
Fine. Tell me in advance,
I'll wear a different one.

520
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,360
I don't want to wear the same as you.

521
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,740
Captain Leng.

522
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,339
The primary crime scene

523
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,220
has been fully processed by our team.

524
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,220
Tell me about this community.

525
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,579
Shancheng Community

526
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:57,460
was built over twenty years ago.

527
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,539
The buildings are old.

528
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,299
Look, over there.

529
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,619
It borders a wooded area.

530
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,619
It's pitch black at night.

531
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:05,980
We immediately

532
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,900
reviewed all accessible

533
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
(Keeping pet in a civilized way)
CCTV footage from the community.

534
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:09,619
(Keeping pet in a legal way)

535
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:10,660
At the south gate,

536
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,260
a suspicious person was spotted.

537
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,900
However, his identity

538
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,579
remains unknown.

539
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,740
Fingerprints and footprints
from the hallway surroundings

540
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,700
and living room

541
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,420
have been re-collected.

542
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,740
The entryway mat was taken
by Beicheng CID.

543
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,299
A total of five bloody footprints
were found

544
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:49,779
on the entryway mat
and in the living room.

545
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,660
Details await further testing.

546
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,099
Zhou.

547
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:45,579
Based on bloodstain distribution,

548
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,980
it's concentrated near the nightstand.

549
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,660
The blood spatter
shows a high-velocity pattern.

550
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,059
This indicates a powerful impact.

551
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,192
I assumed the suspect
is a young or middle-aged male.

552
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,940
Based on the stroke width,

553
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,579
it was likely written
using a blood-soaked finger.

554
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:21,180
But no fingerprints were left.

555
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,619
Captain Leng.

556
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,020
Take a look.

557
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:42,539
Thoughts?

558
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,900
The writing flows smoothly.

559
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,220
The strokes are steady.

560
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,260
And it's in standard script.

561
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,619
What kind of person

562
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,500
writes like this?

563
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:56,819
Composed

564
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,379
and calm.

565
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,139
Probably well-educated.

566
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:07,539
After committing such extreme violence,

567
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:10,980
he still had composure
to write on the wall.

568
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,660
I think he is someone meticulous

569
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,379
and unflappable.

570
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,460
It was likely premeditated.

571
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:37,304

(Forensic Unit)

579
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,099
Based on blood coagulation at the scene

580
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:26,900
and livor mortis,

581

(Blood details at the crime scene)
the exact time of death was...

582
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,500
The time of death

583
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,420
was between 12 AM

584
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,059
(Blood details at the crime scene)
and 1 AM the next day.

585
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,900
Resulted from acute cerebral hemorrhage.

586
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,259
The victim's skull

587
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:42,099
(Blood details at the crime scene)
shows a depressed fracture,

588
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,380
matching the corner of the nightstand.

589
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,288
(Blood details at the crime scene)

590
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:48,619
We can infer

591
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:49,739
the suspect

592
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,539
grabbed the victim's head

593
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,179
and slammed it against the corner.

594
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Repeated, forceful impacts

595
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,619
ruptured the left pericallosal artery

596
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,659
and the left central artery,

597
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,120
causing massive intracranial bleeding
and victim's death.

598
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:06,420
Other wounds on the victim's body

599
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,820
were inflicted shortly after death.

600
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:11,460
(Victim's wound details)

601
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,739
There are seventeen wounds total

602
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,139
on the victim's torso and limbs.

603
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:16,380
Look.

604
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,619
These seventeen wounds
are straight, sharp,

605
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,820
(Victim's wound details)
and uniform in length.

606
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,579
This requires the suspect

607
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:26,579
to possess precise control.

608
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:28,099
Moreover, I noticed

609
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:30,659
during the cutting,

610
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,300
a downward pressure was applied.

611
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:35,020
This motion matches
a scalpel user's technique.

612
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,739
No fingerprints were found on scene.

613
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:40,536
The killer wore gloves

614
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:42,380
both during the murder
and writing on the wall.

615
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,500
(Blood writing on the crime scene wall)

616
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,579
I compared common types

617
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,020
like cotton, synthetic fiber,
cloth, leather,

618
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,179
and latex gloves.

619
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:52,420
Only non-absorbent types
can be dipped in blood for writing.

620
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:53,380
After elimination,

621
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,860
only leather and latex
remain possibilities.

622
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:58,020
Leather gloves

623
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,619
are typically bulkier than fingers.

624
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:02,460
When I tried writing in them,

625
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,900
caused by the finger squeezing,

626
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,980
the writing shows breaks or distortions.

627
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,659
Difficult to write words with
uniform strokes on the wall,

628
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,096
let alone the fluidity of the writing
on the crime scene wall.

629
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,280
Leather gloves out.

630
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:13,780
As for the last possibility,

631
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,059
latex gloves are characterized
by high elasticity,

632
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,219
smooth surface,

633
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,699
and fit closest
to the size of human fingers.

634
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,300
I bought commonly available
latex gloves on the market.

635
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,020
(Blood writing on the crime scene wall)
After testing with blood,

636
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,380
I preliminarily assumed the killer

637
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,940
wore medical latex gloves.

638
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,059
These gloves have talcum powder on them,

639
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,020
which has

640
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,460
a certain adhesive effect on the blood.

641
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,259
This can result in dripping blood trails

642
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:39,860
(Wretch)
forming below the writing.

643
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,380
(Suspect's shoe printings
left on the crime scene floor)

644
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,300
Around the hallway,

645
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,699
on the entryway mat
and inside the crime scene,

646
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,420
a total of five footprints
were collected.

647
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,500
All are of size 43,

648
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,099
mold-soled sneakers.

649
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,500
The tread pattern shows minimal wear,

650
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
indicating the shoes
might be relatively new.

651
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,619
However, because this type of product

652
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,739
is extremely common on the market,

653
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,139
it has little reference value.

654
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:04,059
Due to the small number
of footprints collected

655
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:05,099
and their discontinuity,

656
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,780
we can currently only roughly
infer that the suspect is

657
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,579
(Suspect's shoe printings)
a male of medium build.

658
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,739
We cannot infer

659
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:13,659
more specific physical characteristics.

660
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,099
The Shancheng Community

661
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,020
has cameras only at the main gates

662
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,139
on the north and south sides
for vehicle access.

663
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:23,500
Those at the side gates
on the east and west,

664
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,139
and between buildings,
are just for show,

665
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:26,900
not even powered.

666
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,179
Colleagues from Beicheng

667
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:34,020
had conducted
a preliminary review of the footage.

668
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,739
(Suspicious individual entering/exiting)
The time of this individual

669
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:39,500
entering and exiting
through the south gate

670
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,940
matches the time of the crime.

671
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,059
Thus, Beicheng CID

672
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,980
identified this person
as the prime suspect.

673
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:45,720
(Victim's ex-husband entering/exiting)

674
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:46,460
Okay.

675
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,099
From this image, we can see

676
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,380
he's wearing exactly a pair of

677
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,300
mold-soled sneakers.

678
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
(Victim's ex-husband entering/exiting)

679
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,699
This person is the victim's
ex-husband, Wu Da.

680
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,500
Captain Sun's team has confirmed

681
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,099
that Wang Xiaole's boyfriend,
Huang Chong,

682
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,940
was working overtime at the company
that night.

683
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,940
His colleagues can attest to this.

684
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:06,460
Wang Xiaole's parents also stated

685
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:08,420
that the two had a good relationship.

686
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,420
Moreover, both are
in their second marriage,

687
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,739
with no financial conflicts.

688
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:15,820
However,
Wang Xiaole's ex-husband, Wu Da,

689
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,420
was seen entering and exiting
the Shancheng Community

690
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,216
at 9 PM and 10 PM
on the night of the crime.

691
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,579
Wu Da's semen was indeed
found inside the victim.

692
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,579
But there's no evidence
of forced sexual activity at the scene.

693
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:27,619
All evidence suggests

694
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:29,659
the sexual encounter was consensual.

695
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,739
They were divorced,

696
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,259
yet they maintained that relationship.

697
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:34,739
We need to look into it.

698
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,940
Wu Da,

699
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,460
we're here today

700
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:14,259
to learn more

701
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:15,420
about Wang Xiaole.

702
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,259
Where did you injure your hand?

703
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,099
I forgot.

704
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,780
Probably bumped into something.

705
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:36,760

(Vascular Surgery, Dermatologic Surgery)

708
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,896
(Clinical Oncology)

709
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,179
How did he get so drunk?

710
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,659
He was also like this
during your previous questioning?

711
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,259
Yes.

712
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,059
He was like this.

713
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,659
(Surgery, Surgical Nursing)
It's said that ever since the divorce,

714
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,900
(Vascular Surgery)
he's been drowning his sorrows in drink.

715
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,219
(Clinical Oncology)
He seems unable to accept this reality.

716
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,500
Do you know Wang Xiaole?

717
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:01,860
My wife...

718
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,860
Ex-wife.

719
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,059
What were you doing
from 12 AM on the 9th

720
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:09,579
to 1 AM on the 10th?

721
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:11,259
Drinking.

722
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,460
Where were you drinking?

723
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,739
Specific location.

724
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:21,460
The flower bed at the north gate
of Shancheng Community.

725
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,980
Can anyone verify that?

726
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,539
Verify?

727
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,300
Verify what?

728
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,860
What exactly happened, Officer?

729
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,940
You went to Wang Xiaole's place
last night, didn't you?

730
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,420
Why did you go there?

731
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,699
I just... We...

732
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,219
I went to get...

733
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:46,539
Wait, officer.
I'm feeling really unwell.

734
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,539
Can you just tell me what's wrong?

735
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,619
Here.

736
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:08,380
