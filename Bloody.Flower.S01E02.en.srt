Moon Se Guk lied,

00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:09,862
but as for me,

4
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:12,932
I can cure Min Seo's illness.

5
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,132
Every single one of them...

6
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,042
was treated by me.

7
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:24,082
You must be hungry.
Come on, let's go inside.

8
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:26,012
Mom, can we make a quick stop
at the convenience store first?

9
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:27,582
There's something I'm really craving.

10
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:30,452
Gosh. Fine. Let's go.

11
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:33,992
Excuse me?

12
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,762
Are you Kang Sang Woo?

13
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:41,192
Yes, that's me.

14
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:43,262
You are?

15
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,502
Who are you?

00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:56,012

This is Cha Yi Yeon
from Violent Crimes Unit One.

21
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:49,662
I'll cut to the chase.
We've found all the victims' bodies.

22
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:56,102
But to be blunt, we didn't find them.
Lee Woo Gyeom confessed.

23
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,842
Where did you dump the remaining victims?

24
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,772
On the mid-slope of Mount Cheonggye,

25

facing the river,
at the 100-meter mark.

26
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:04,982
Is he trying to get a reduced sentence?

27
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:08,152
Yes. He asked me about a plea bargain.

28
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,382
I don't want a lighter sentence.

29
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:12,222
I want to make a different kind of deal.

To this day, the number of victims,
their identities, the body locations...

He's never given a straight answer
about any of it.

32
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:23,332
He's toying with us even as we speak.

33
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,902
He has no regard for human life,

34

He's deceiving the entire nation watching,

That's just like you, Attorney Park.

What do you mean? "Just like me?"

48
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,752
You think you know me?

49
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:22,622
That you're a good father
who loves Min Seo more than anything...

50
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,892
Don't talk so casually about my daughter.

51
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,592
Gosh, it was a compliment.
That's a little harsh.

52
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:32,202
Did you really cure Sang Woo?

53
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,002
Didn't you see him walking?

54
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:39,772
That Sang Woo was cured because of you.
That's something I...

55
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,112
How am I supposed to believe that?

That's the only way
you'll want to see the real thing.

59
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,392
Attorney Park,

60
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:58,022
when people come back from the dead,

61
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,992
they come to realize
more than what meets the eye.

62
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,862
I was in a coma for three years
after a car accident.

63
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,672
I had no idea how I woke up,

64
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:17,742
much less why.

65
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:23,152
My doctor said I had a new blood mutation,

66
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,422
but I couldn't just take his word for it.

67
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:30,992
I was just an ordinary med student
back then.

68
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:36,132
But there was another problem.

69
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:39,932
As an aftereffect of the accident,

70
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,542
waves of pain would hit me out of nowhere.

71
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,942
The exact same pain
I felt during the car crash.

72
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,852
I couldn't find the cause.

73
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,722
So, since I was living
on borrowed time anyway,

74
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:05,422
I started experimenting on my own body.

75
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:10,332
I did all sorts of crazy things,
not caring if I died.

76
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,602
I injected myself with anything
that could possibly be a cure.

77
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:21,472
But then one day,

78
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,042
the pain was gone.

79
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:27,612
I had created a cure
for an incurable disease.

80
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:30,482
For the very disease that
they said was untreatable.

81
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:35,352
The pain, the aftereffects of the coma...
They were all gone.

82
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:41,032
You're saying you found a cure?

83
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:45,872
Yes. And I realized that method
could be used to cure other diseases too.

84
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:49,842
You can really...

85
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,372
You can cure the Batten disease,
can't you?

86
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:03,252
No one believed me at first.

87
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,152
But they all survived,

88
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:11,322
and every single person who woke up
was grateful to me.

89
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,562
Life and death...

90
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:18,332
It's nothing to me.

91
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,302
(Court)

92
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:28,512

- Bring it back!

93
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,482
- Bring it back!
- Harsh punishment for violent criminals!

94

- Punish them!
- Punish them!

95
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:36,022
- That's Lee Woo Gyeom!
- Murderer! Killer!

96
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,622
- Killer!
- Murderer!

97
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:43,162
- Lee Woo Gyeom, you murderer!
- Hey, killer!

00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:47,132
- Bring back the death penalty!

Following the arrest of
serial killer Lee Woo Gyeom,

100
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,532
public support for resuming executions
has been rising dramatically.

101
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,172
According to a recent poll,

102
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,702
a staggering 74.3 percent
of respondents said...

103
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:01,142
they were in favor of resuming executions.

104
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:03,742
Meanwhile, the attorney
handling Lee Woo Gyeom's trial,

105
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:07,212
Park Han Jun,
is also facing continued controversy.

106
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:09,622
Attorney Park was
formerly a prosecutor for...

107
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,922
the Central Investigation Department...

108
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,652
before becoming a civil rights attorney.
However, in recent years...

109
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:27,272
The defendant killed 17 people.
Is that correct?

110
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:28,672
Yes.

111
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:32,072
And you claim you killed them
while experimenting to create a cure?

112
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,272
- Yes, that's correct.
- Assuming your claim is true,

113
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:38,042
the process
in which 17 people were killed.

114
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:42,182
- Where are the records of that research?
- Your Honor.

115
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:48,292
The records in Exhibit 23 contain
the research on the 17 victims.

116
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:49,562
Your Honor.

117
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,962
However, the victims' bodies
are so severely mutilated...

118
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:58,062
that the National Forensic Service reports
they can't confirm their identities.

119

(Prosecution)

120
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:11,142
Defendant!

121
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:16,622
If your goal was research,
why dismember the victims so brutally?

122
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:18,982
If your goal was truly research, then why!

123
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,962
Why did Hong Jae Gwang have to be murdered
and left in such a wretched state?

124
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,762
(Defendant)

125
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:34,402
Your Honor.

126
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,702
If the defendant's true intention
was research,

127
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:43,282
would he have needed to desecrate
the victims' bodies to such an extent?

128
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,112
How interesting.

129
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:47,352
Therefore, we contend that this case...

130
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,782
is just a series of thrill kills
by a psychopathic murderer.

131
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:51,852
Your Honor.

132
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:55,252
The prosecution's assertion
of "thrill kills" is...

133
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:58,622
merely an emotional argument
with no evidence whatsoever.

134
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:02,462
Sustained.
Prosecutor, do you have any grounds?

135
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:05,162
Yes. I'll present them now.

136
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:08,202
Defendant.

137
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:11,602
You're familiar with
Jo Gyeong Chan, correct?

138
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:12,942
Yes.

139
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,812
Five years ago, you were hit by a car
driven by Jo Gyeong Chan,

140
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:21,952
which left you in a coma for three years.
How did you feel about that?

141
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,622
You must have been angry, right?

142
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:28,052
Resentful that this happened to you.
And over time,

143
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,922
towards the person responsible
for the accident,

144
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:33,962
you must have felt anger
and a desire for revenge.

145
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,462
- That's not true.
- It's not?

146
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:37,532
No, it is not.

147
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:40,072
Then why did you seek out
and murder Jo Gyeong Chan?

148
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:41,402
Jo Gyeong Chan?

149
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:14,602
Your Honor. The defendant's crimes...

150
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:18,672
were premeditated murders born
from anger and a desire for revenge.

151
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:22,812
He targeted adults whose disappearances
were unlikely to be investigated,

152
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,712
making this a clear case
of calculated serial murder.

153
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,852
I submit their traffic accident record
as evidence.

154
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,482
The accident between the defendant
and the victim, Jo Gyeong Chan,

155
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:51,102
- Look at him.
- Darn... He's a monster.

156
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,242
Stop provoking them.

157
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,642
I'm not provoking them. It's just absurd.

158
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,982
- Look at him. My goodness.
- Order!

159
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,982
I will have you removed
from the courtroom if not.

160
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,282
(Defendant)

161
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:09,022
Counsel for the defense, your rebuttal.

162
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:12,632
(Defense Counsel)

163
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:14,262
Your Honor.

164
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,762
The prosecution's argument...

165
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:20,632
does have some merit.

166
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:25,142
And that's because you have yet to hear
the details of how my client...

167
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,472
performed his treatments.

168
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,282
Are you saying you can explain
the treatment process?

169
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,112
I won't just explain it.

170
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,992
I'll show you firsthand.

171
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,592
I would like to call as witnesses
the six terminally ill patients...

172
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:50,632
whom the defendant claims to have cured.

173
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:01,912
So who are the witnesses?

174
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,642
I still have to find them.

175
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,082
What?

176
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:09,152
So you were just bluffing?

177
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,382
I had to shift the momentum of the trial.

178
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:14,192
It was leaning in Prosecutor Cha's favor
from the start.

179
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:19,862
You make it sound like it's my fault.

180
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,462
That's because it is.

181
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:25,362
Why did you have to mutilate
the bodies like that?

182
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,572
You only call it "mutilation"
because you see it as murder.

183
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,672
"Why are you dissecting a frog
so cruelly?"

184
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:33,542
That's the exact same question.

185
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,012
But Hong Jae Gwang was different.

186
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:37,442
Because the experiment with him
was a success.

187
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:41,752
So you drained all of his blood?

188
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:45,422
Yes, that's when I figured out
how to create the cure.

189
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:52,122
To you, when it comes to your experiments,

190
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,962
murder is just part of the process.

191
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:02,202
If Hong Jae Gwang's experiment failed,
you wouldn't have stopped at 17, right?

192
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:04,302
Just be honest with me.

193
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:06,542
Stop lying.

194
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,742
- Lie about what?
- Because you wanted to kill him.

195
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,012
That's why you killed him.

196
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:16,152
That's why you killed
Jo Gyeong Chan first, isn't it?

197
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,822
Be honest with me about your motive,

198
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:24,962
and let's focus on proving your ability.
If you're caught lying in court,

199
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:26,992
you won't escape the death penalty.

200
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:28,562
I don't care.

201
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,162
They won't execute me anyway.

202
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:36,972
Besides, would they really execute someone
who can cure the terminally ill?

203
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,112
That's only...

204
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:44,982
if your treatment is recognized.
Only if it's recognized.

205
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:48,682
That's why...

206
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:52,622
I need you to get my ability recognized
through this trial.

207
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:54,522
Get those witnesses to testify too.

208
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,922
That's the only way to treat Min Seo,
right?

It's not too late. Please, just drop it.

I'll try to persuade the director again.

215
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:29,792
It's fine.

216
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:35,692
How is this fine?
You're not thinking straight.

217
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,662
Why on earth would you agree
to defend a serial killer?

- I have to do this.

220

But why?

My GPS can't seem to find the place.

227

The roads around here are a real maze,
so it's hard to find.

What do you see around you?

00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,652
Not much besides the sky,

230
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,722
And a long flight of stairs to my right.

231
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:41,762
- See the sky? Then you're almost here.
- Really?

232
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:44,732
I see your car.

Gosh.

00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:26,772
It feels lived in.

This is your spot right here.

Instant coffee or cold water?

No, I'm good.

246
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:37,722
Come on, at least let me...

247
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,242
Here, have a nice, cold glass.

Don't worry, the water's clean.

If six witnesses claim Lee Woo Gyeom
cured their incurable diseases,

00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:16,092
do you think the court will see
the case a little differently?

251
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,162
They'd have to.

252
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,632
It would completely change
the motive for the murders.

253
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:24,262
Yes.

254
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,302

About Lee Woo Gyeom,

256
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:31,202
I heard they're moving him
to solitary confinement.

257
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,212
It's just a psychological tactic
to corner him.

258
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:38,512
This puts us at a disadvantage
in so many ways.

263

It's a reporter named Jo Woo Cheol.

264

He's the one who's clashed with
the financial crimes unit before.

265

Can't you shut him up?

to this kind of tabloid trash.

are you calling about that strange article
that was published today?

Yes, of course. The director is back.
One moment, please.

Hey. What's wrong with Min Seo?

303
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,692
It must have been the increased dosage.

304

She's stable for now,
but I'll run some more detailed tests.

Let's try to get that new drug again.

308
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,582
That drug was only tested on adults.

309
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,282
It could be dangerous
for children like Min Seo.

310

Doing the same thing over and over
is what's keeping our Min Seo alive.

Listen to me.

will get healthy again.

00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,632
And I will make sure she does.

322
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:53,972
I'm sorry.

323
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:56,702
Appearing in court...

324
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:59,002
It's too much for me.

325
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:01,442
Ma'am,

326
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:03,642
we just need you to testify...

327
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:06,312
that Sang Woo was treated...

328
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:09,512
by Lee Woo Gyeom. That's all.

329
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:11,152
My Sang Woo...

330
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:13,622
Even though he's recovered,

331
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:16,662
it's still not easy for him
to face the world.

332
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:18,462
I don't want the whole world to know...

333
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:20,932
the fact that my son was sick.

334
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:27,672
If people find out he was treated
by a murderer, what will they think?

335
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,132
I'm sorry.

336
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,672
Wait... Ma'am!

337
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:41,612
What about the patient, Oh Min Gyu?

338
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:43,822
Have you reached him?

339
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:48,052
His testimony is on record,
but we haven't confirmed his identity yet.

340
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:52,922
Also, all six patients treated
by Lee Woo Gyeom are refusing to testify.

341
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:57,102
If we want to bring them in,
we might have to subpoena them.

342
00:23:57,162 --> 00:24:00,002
No, absolutely not. If we do that,

343
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,372
we might not get the testimony we need.

344
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:07,612
- So, what do we do?
- We just have to keep...

345
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,512
trying to persuade them.

Something about that punk
just rubs me the wrong way.

350
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,372
I heard that he killed
17 people all by himself.

351
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:42,872
Seventeen people?

352
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,542
- What crew is he with?
- He's not with any crew.

353
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:48,182
They say he came up as a lone wolf.

354
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:49,882
A lone wolf.

355
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:53,892
Go on.

356
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,492
Stare all you want.

357
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:58,222
Once we're in the same cell,
I'll beat you senseless.

358
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:01,992
- Damn it.
- You fool!

359
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:12,602
(Please be quiet.)

360
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:19,782
Changing the witnesses' minds...

361
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:21,852
is going to take some time.

362
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,122
How cheap.

363
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,022
And to think they were begging me
to save them.

364
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:29,392
Of all the patients you treated,

365
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:31,062
by any chance,

366
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:33,432
do you remember a patient
named Oh Min Gyu?

367
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,692
Yes. The one with Batten disease.

368
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:38,702
Can you get in touch with him?

369
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:42,702
No.
Once their treatment is over, that's it.

370
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,142
I see.

371
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:48,642
But it must be nice to be Min Seo.

372
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,412
Having a father who only cares about her.

373
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:53,042
Focus on your case.

374
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:56,982
Alright, then.

375
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:01,952
Don't you have some kind of record
of how you treated them?

376
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:04,622
- Of course I do.
- You do?

377
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:09,992
But the witnesses have to testify
for the court to admit them as evidence.

378
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,902
Since the witnesses can't testify now,
just submitting those records...

379
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:16,872
is our best shot.

380
00:26:19,572 --> 00:26:23,342
If you go to my study,
there should be a red notebook.

381

That's my research log.

382
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:28,212
But I'm pretty sure
the police have already taken it.

Please, just let me go.

where Lee Woo Gyeom...

393
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:52,522
dismembered his victim. Check this out.

394
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,262
- Hey.
- The vibe in here is insane, right?

395
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:57,862
Is this that "dare challenge"
that's going around?

396
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,702
Yes. If this video blows up,
I can get ad revenue.

- And the top guys make over a grand.
- Okay, I get it. Hey, Attorney Park.

398

As you know,
we can't guard the scene 24 hours a day.

399
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,912
And besides,

400
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:13,312
this is on the kid who crossed the tape,
right?

401

Yes, I'm sorry.

If you lie, you could be charged
with trespassing and obstructing justice,

405

and a fine of up to five grand.
Understand?

407
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,002
Tell me the truth.

408
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:32,962
Did you go inside...

409
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,532
or not?

410
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,702
I swear I only filmed nearby.

411
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,442
Besides, the doors were all locked.

412
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,872

Back when I was on the bench,

426

everyone was in an uproar
about some hothead who had just joined,

427
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:34,362
and he told me he was the one
who took you under his wing.

You mean the troublemaker,
the top student at the Training Institute?

429
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:40,872
You should worry less
about other people...

430
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:42,972
and more about the murderer
you're defending.

431
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:47,412
Hello.

432
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:53,042
I know you're all very busy,

433
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,182
so I appreciate your cooperation.

434
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:59,282
The defense witness will be present,

435
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:01,692
- correct?
- Yes.

436
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:03,792
That is correct.

437
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:09,332
At the next hearing,
based on the witnesses' testimonies,

438
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:12,262
we'll determine if the crime's motive
was truly to heal people or not.

439
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:14,232
We will examine that closely.

440
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,802
A change in motive...

441
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,602
- won't change the outcome of this case.
- But the sentencing guidelines...

442
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,612
could change, though.

443
00:31:23,012 --> 00:31:24,012
Look,

444
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,482
he killed 17 people.

445

Seemed pretty accurate to me.

449
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:45,432
And what part of it is supposedly factual?

450
00:31:46,402 --> 00:31:47,402
Why?

451
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:51,302
If it's not true, then prove it.

453

- What?

It's total chaos!

I'm almost there. I can see the office.
Hang on.

00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:44,582
Everyone, just stop for a second.

482
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,022
I...

483
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:51,122
happen to share this office space.

484
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:53,422
So anything that belongs to me...

485
00:33:54,562 --> 00:33:57,092
is absolutely off-limits. Understood?

486
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:04,002
Sir, isn't this your desk?

487
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:07,372
Your business cards are right here.

488
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:08,742
About that...

489
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:12,442
I put them in the wrong spot.

490
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,212
This is my desk right here.

491
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:21,392
Yes. That's right.
That's actually my desk.

492
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:22,692
Yes, go ahead and take it.

493
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:27,562
Sir, you're making this difficult.
This is clear obstruction of justice.

494
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:31,062
Fine, then. Take whatever you want.

495
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,472
But just know I'll be suing you
for larceny...

496
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:39,042
for illegally taking my property.
We'll see who has the bigger headache.

497
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:40,912
Just you wait.

498
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:49,052
Man, what a chaotic day.
I thought I was going to lose my mind.

499
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:51,552
That was Prosecutor Cha's doing, right?

500
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:54,292
I heard she comes from
a pretty powerful family.

501
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,392
She's the youngest daughter
of Sejin Group, right?

502
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:57,722
That's right.

503
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,862
So what's the bad blood between you two?

504
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:03,432
She was my student back when
I taught at the Training Institute.

505
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,632
But regardless of her family,

506
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:09,802
she was the sharpest student
I ever taught...

507
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,802
and the biggest pain in my neck.

508
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:15,712
Gosh. For a student to be that rude
to her teacher...

509
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:21,412
Man, today's been a mess.
When I'm stressed, I like to eat.

510
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:25,452
Let's get a drink.
Hey, Min Gyeong! Over here!

511
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:27,392
Attorney Park.

512
00:35:29,422 --> 00:35:31,022
- What's this?
- I invited her.

513
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:34,792
Have you been well?

514
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:36,892
Yes, I've been fine.

515
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:38,902
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

516
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,502
So, are you really not going
to hire me back?

517
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,072
CEO Heo said Hae Gang will pay my salary,

518
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:52,742
and that it's okay for me
to come and help you.

519
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,352
Just stay at Hae Gang
and keep doing your job there.

520
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:57,152
Attorney Park.

521
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:02,222
After you left, I wasn't assigned
to a new supervising attorney,

522
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,022
so all I do every day is make copies.
This has to be better than that.

523
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:06,962
Gosh, what are you talking about?

524
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:15,202
Attorney Park.
What if we let Min Gyeong here...

525
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,232
try to meet with a witness?

526
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:18,602
The witnesses?

527
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:21,272
You haven't secured a witness yet?

528
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,542
Not yet.

529
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:27,652
Since it's a serial murder case,
most witnesses are reluctant to cooperate.

530
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,552
Then let me give it a try.

531
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:34,052
What?

532
00:36:34,522 --> 00:36:37,322
I happen to be amazing
at getting people on board.

533
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,792
For example, at my college festival,

534
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:43,792
I set up all the lonely students
on group dates,

535
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:47,532
and our pop-up bar broke the all-time
school sales record. That was all me.

536
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:51,472
But...

537
00:36:51,902 --> 00:36:55,742
- Recruiting a witness isn't exactly...
- You don't need a certificate for that.

538
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:59,442
I don't have a certificate,
but I do have confidence.

539
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:04,682
Maybe it's because
we're a couple of dreary faces...

540
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,682
that it hasn't been working out.

541
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:08,822
I know I can do a really good job.

542
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:10,452
Please?

543
00:37:13,222 --> 00:37:15,862
For crying out loud.
What's gotten into you two?

544
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:18,662
All right, fine. Then...

545
00:37:19,102 --> 00:37:23,632
Min Gyeong has no field experience,
so Reporter Jo, show her the ropes.

546
00:37:23,832 --> 00:37:26,042
Of course. That's my specialty.

547
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:29,872
Min Gyeong, looking forward to working
with you. I'm Jo Woo Cheol.

548
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:31,382
Hey, I'm just going to speak casually.

549
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:33,742
Since you decided
to speak informally first,

550
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:35,812
I'll do the same.

551
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,382
- What?
- I'm just kidding, sir.

552
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:43,252
- Well, then, shall we have a drink?
- All right.

553
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,392
- All right, glasses up.
- Yes.

554
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:47,532
- Cheers.
- Good.

555
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:52,902
Lee Woo Gyeom will surely pay
for his crimes, right?

556
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:56,502
But if it's true that he really cured
an incurable disease...

557
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:59,242
so that he can help even more people,

558
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,072
we have to at least give it a shot,
don't we?

559
00:38:06,212 --> 00:38:07,212
Ma'am.

560
00:38:08,012 --> 00:38:12,852
For the other patients and families
who are going through the same pain,

561
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:14,392
please,

562
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:16,892
I'm begging you.

563
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:20,762
I understand.

564
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:23,532
I'll testify.

565
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:27,402
Thank you, ma'am.

566
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:30,372
There's something.

567
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:34,512
I received this.

568
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,142
(From Lee Woo Gyeom)

569
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:48,292
(To the sea)

570
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:52,492
What in the world is this letter?
Did Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom really write this?

571
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:58,662
If word gets out that I was sick,
it'll hurt my reputation at work.

572
00:38:59,732 --> 00:39:01,172
Please don't worry.

573
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:04,032
Information about witnesses
is kept strictly confidential.

574
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,972
- And we'll...
- But this is going too far.

575
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:08,842
You're threatening to leak
my personal information to the press?

576
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:20,082
You can promise me that nothing
will happen to my Sang Woo, right?

577
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:22,052
Look, I'll agree to testify,

578
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:24,292
but I won't be threatened like this.

579
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:27,362
I promise I'll do whatever it takes...

580
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:31,162
to make sure you're not harmed by this.
I'm counting on you.

581
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:36,332
This is the only way
the witnesses will testify.

582
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:38,642
Nothing good will come
from provoking the witnesses.

583
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,502
You have to provoke them
to get a reaction.

584
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:44,442
You think all witnesses are on your side?
They could do something unpredictable.

585
00:39:47,682 --> 00:39:48,682
From now on,

586
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:51,922
everything and anything
related to this trial,

587
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:53,882
you run by me first.

588
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:55,822
Got it?

589
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:07,532
Yes.

590
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,202
Prosecutor Cha.

591
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:16,112
Here's the defense's witness list.

592
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,372
Thank you.

593
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:19,382
The mother of a patient
Lee Woo Gyeom saved...

594
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:21,912
and an actual patient he treated
are being called as witnesses.

595
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:25,182
Polio.

596
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:27,322
Blood cancer.

597
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:32,292
(Kang Sang Woo, 18 years old,
Congenital incurable polio)

598
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:33,362
Kang Sang Woo.

599
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:35,262
Incurable polio.

600
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:39,962
He had never walked a single step
in his life.

601
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:41,772
Right.

602
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:46,202
Apparently, at a support group
for families with incurable diseases,

603
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:50,972
Sang Woo's mother met Lee Woo Gyeom
by Song Tae Jin's sister.

604
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:57,452
Mr. Song had terminal blood cancer,
but he's now been declared fully cured.

605
00:40:57,982 --> 00:40:59,522
Of the six patients...

606
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:00,652
with incurable diseases
that Lee Woo Gyeom treated,

607
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,022
we've been unable to contact
the other four.

608
00:41:03,152 --> 00:41:05,822
Let's focus on the confirmed witnesses,
Kang Sang Woo's mother...

609
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:07,732
and Mr. Song Tae Jin.

610
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:11,302
The court will absolutely want to know...

611
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,932
how Lee Woo Gyeom treated these people.

612
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:17,102
So the question is how, in what way,

613
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:19,402
we should disclose that. That's...

614
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:22,242
That's the challenge.

615
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:27,282
Attorney Park.

616
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:32,652
You're worried about that letter he sent
to the witnesses, aren't you?

617
00:41:33,382 --> 00:41:34,392
Yes.

618
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:35,952
The witnesses...

619
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:38,362
I didn't want to force them to testify.

620
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:42,332
Should we file for a postponement then?

621
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,792
No, no.

622
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:49,032
Given how impulsive Lee Woo Gyeom is,
there's no telling what he might do next.

623
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:52,602
Let's find a better option for now.

624
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:54,872
And do our absolute best...

625
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:56,872
to be prepared.

626
00:41:56,942 --> 00:42:01,212
Well then, no time like the present.
Let's get right to it, good?

627
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:02,482
Sure, sounds good.

628
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:05,582
I'd much rather pull an all-nighter
than just be on copy duty.

629
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:08,952
So, should I finally show you
what I'm made of?

630
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,942
- Thanks for all your hard work.
- Good job.

631
00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:32,312
- Bye.
- See you later.

632
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:49,132
Today is the 4th hearing of the 1st trial
of the Lee Woo Gyeom case.

633
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:52,332
The focus of this trial
is expected to be...

634
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:55,132
on the witnesses' testimony
about the treatment.

635
00:42:55,732 --> 00:42:56,972
Witness.

636
00:42:56,972 --> 00:43:01,212
Is it true you entrusted the defendant,
Lee Woo Gyeom,

637
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:03,112
with treating your son, Sang Woo,

638
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:07,142
- for his polio?
- Yes.

639
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:09,052
That's correct.

640
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:12,522
Then could you please describe
what happened at that time?

641
00:43:13,152 --> 00:43:15,492
He came with a bag of medical instruments.

642
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:17,152
And...

643
00:43:18,192 --> 00:43:20,862
he injected what he called a "cure"
into Sang Woo's arm.

644
00:43:21,092 --> 00:43:24,832
And what were Sang Woo's symptoms
after the injection?

645
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,262
Sang Woo seemed tired and fell asleep.

646
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:29,802
He didn't wake up until dawn.

647
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:31,502
How do you...

648
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:35,042
- remember that after all this time?
- That morning,

649
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:39,442
Sang Woo suddenly cried out and stood up.

650
00:43:41,982 --> 00:43:42,982
He stood up?

651
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,622
So that everyone
in this court can hear you,

652
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:50,022
please say that again...

653
00:43:50,952 --> 00:43:52,062
in a loud, clear voice.

654
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:54,392
Yes.

655
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,492
He stood up!

656
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:04,102
Could you describe that moment...

657
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:07,442
in more detail?

658
00:44:08,672 --> 00:44:11,342
"Mom! Mom, look at this!"

659
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:14,282
That's what he shouted.

660
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:18,782
I was shocked and rushed to his room,
and when I got there,

661
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:22,692
he was standing on his own two feet.

662
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:26,692
That's right.

663
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:29,962
Not once in 18 years.

664
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,362
Sang Woo, who could never stand,

665
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:35,432
was standing there,
completely on his own,

666
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:38,702
right there in front of the witness.

667
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:41,002
Witness,

668
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,972
that is the truth, is it not?

669
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:44,612
Yes.

670
00:44:45,212 --> 00:44:48,082
- He was standing all on his own.
- And after that,

671
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,452
did Sang Woo's condition get worse,
or did it not?

672
00:44:52,682 --> 00:44:53,882
It did not.

673
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:56,522
It was as if Sang Woo
had been given a new life.

674
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:59,262
He told me how incredibly grateful he was
to Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

675
00:45:01,562 --> 00:45:03,092
He asked me to be sure to tell him that.

676
00:45:11,302 --> 00:45:12,372
Thank you.

677
00:45:14,302 --> 00:45:15,712
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

678
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:23,552
Prosecutor.
You may begin your cross-examination.

679
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:30,192
Witness, how many hospitals gave you
the incurable polio diagnosis for him?

680
00:45:31,252 --> 00:45:33,022
Around seven, I believe.

681
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:36,592
And did you tell each new hospital
of the previous diagnosis?

682
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:41,132
Yes. So they'd know
what treatments he'd already had.

683
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:42,672
Was that really the reason?

684
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:48,842
Your insurance payouts for Sang Woo
were over 80,000 dollars in total.

685
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:51,842
Isn't it true
you couldn't risk a different diagnosis?

686
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:52,942
Your Honor.

687
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,282
This line of questioning
is completely irrelevant...

688
00:45:57,352 --> 00:45:58,782
to the efficacy of the treatment.

689
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:04,352
I am trying to establish that
if she intentionally shared the diagnosis,

690
00:46:04,422 --> 00:46:07,192
even if the incurable polio
was a misdiagnosis,

691
00:46:07,262 --> 00:46:10,592
the same diagnosis
would simply have been repeated.

692
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,132
I'll allow it. You may continue.

693
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:26,212
I'd like to call Seo Yeong Seok
from the National Forensic Service.

694
00:46:26,312 --> 00:46:30,512
When a prior diagnosis is shared,
the same mistake is more likely to occur.

695
00:46:30,812 --> 00:46:33,322
Can't they just ignore
the previous records?

696
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:38,492
When you see dozens of patients a day,
it's hard to question the first diagnosis.

697
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,792
What about in the case of Kang Sang Woo?

698
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:44,262
Since there are no recorded cases
of a full recovery from incurable polio,

699
00:46:44,492 --> 00:46:48,502
- I think Sang Woo had another disease.
- Just a moment.

700
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:52,072
- So the diagnosis was a misdiagnosis?
- Yes.

701
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:56,472
The disease most often misdiagnosed
as incurable polio...

702
00:46:57,312 --> 00:46:58,512
is Segawa's disease.

703
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:06,082
The two present such similar symptoms
that even doctors get confused. However,

704
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:09,152
unlike incurable polio,
Segawa's disease...

705
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:10,922
is completely curable.

706
00:47:11,822 --> 00:47:16,562
In your expert opinion, what he treated
was not incurable polio, is that correct?

707
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:17,792
Yes, that is correct.

708
00:47:17,892 --> 00:47:21,972
To come out now and say
Sang Woo had Segawa's disease...

709
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:25,142
You can't possibly conclude that, can you?

710
00:47:26,102 --> 00:47:28,942
It's more of a stretch to believe
an incurable disease was cured.

711
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:30,972
Either way,

712
00:47:31,742 --> 00:47:33,612
the defendant, Lee Yu Gyeom...

713
00:47:34,212 --> 00:47:37,682
- It's a fact that he did treat him.
- Your Honor,

714
00:47:37,912 --> 00:47:41,492
the defense submitted no prior evidence
regarding Segawa's disease.

715
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,792
Sustained.

716
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:46,592
Attorney Park. Confine your questions
to the defendant's original claim.

717
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:48,962
Nothing further.

718
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,532
The court will recess for 30 minutes.

719
00:47:54,002 --> 00:47:56,402
And then proceed with the examination
of the second witness.

720
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:00,202
Let's go.

721
00:48:02,972 --> 00:48:04,612
(Defendant)

722
00:48:04,742 --> 00:48:06,942
- Attorney Park.
- Attorney Park.

723
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:09,282
Did you get a hold of him?

724
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:11,482
I can't get in touch with Song Tae Jin.

725
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:14,892
Right, keep trying.

726
00:48:15,652 --> 00:48:16,652
Okay.

727
00:48:17,822 --> 00:48:18,822
Attorney Park,

728
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:20,822
please begin your examination
of the second witness.

729
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:22,232
Your Honor.

730
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:25,502
There's an issue with
the witness's appearance,

731
00:48:26,202 --> 00:48:28,202
so I request a postponement.

732
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:34,342
Isn't witness testimony
the crux of this trial?

733
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:40,142
A postponement is unacceptable.
The witness is present in the courtroom.

734
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:45,252
Attorney Park,
what is the meaning of this?

735
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:51,862
Your Honor.

736
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:56,332
If the defense is not going to call
Mr. Song Tae Jin to the stand,

737
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:58,962
I request that the prosecution be allowed
to call him as our witness.

738
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:02,932
Your Honor, the witness
the prosecution is referring to...

739
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:04,902
has been watching
the previous witness's testimony...

740
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:07,802
and is likely feeling a great deal
of psychological distress.

741
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:12,242
So, I object to the prosecution's request
to call him to the stand.

742
00:49:14,412 --> 00:49:15,782
Both of you, please be seated.

743
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:25,062
The court will confer,
and then issue a ruling.

744
00:49:35,332 --> 00:49:37,932
The prosecution's request
to call the witness...

745
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:39,872
is granted.

746
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:50,852
Witness.

747
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:01,522
Is it true you also received treatment
from the defendant, Mr. Lee Yu Gyeom?

748
00:50:04,362 --> 00:50:05,832
Yes, that's correct.

749
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,062
And were you completely cured?

750
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:16,672
No, I wasn't cured.
I'm receiving medical treatment again.

751
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:21,182
That man is not a doctor.
He's a complete con man.

752
00:50:21,442 --> 00:50:25,452
He threatened to leak private information,
my medical records, and family details.

753
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:27,252
Don't be fooled by him.

754
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:30,822
Nothing further, Your Honor.

755
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,602
(High Court, District Court)

756
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:46,802
Excuse me, Song Tae Jin.

757
00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:48,842
Wait a second.

758
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:53,912
What on earth...

759
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:57,382
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

760
00:50:58,112 --> 00:51:00,582
I'm asking why you testified
like that in court.

761
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:05,422
Because it's the truth.
I'm getting worse again.

762
00:51:06,192 --> 00:51:07,392
But you clearly said...

763
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:10,932
- You were cured.
- I thought I was.

764
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:13,132
But it came back.

765
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:17,802
Don't you ever...

766
00:51:18,372 --> 00:51:19,872
come near me again.

767
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:32,552
Attorney Park.

768
00:51:34,022 --> 00:51:35,652
Is this really the best you can do?

769
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:38,392
How are we supposed to
win the trial like this?

770
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,392
You're the one who caused this mess.

771
00:51:40,822 --> 00:51:42,292
You're blaming me for this?

772
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:45,302
Yes. This whole thing happened because
you threatened Song Tae Jin.

773
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:47,802
I think you're mistaken.

774
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:50,402
If I can't prove my abilities,

775
00:51:51,502 --> 00:51:52,672
Min Seo will die too.

776
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,842
You... I told you...

777
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:01,412
not to talk so casually about my daughter.

778
00:52:01,482 --> 00:52:05,122
That's my point.
Just let me prove myself already.

779
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,622
That's all it would take,
but you were fumbling with the witnesses,

780
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,222
so I had to step in.

781
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:13,162
You stepped in and ruined everything,
you son of a bitch!

782
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:17,862
(Fresh Sashimi)

783
00:52:17,862 --> 00:52:18,932
Mr. Song Tae Jin.

784
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,472
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced.

785
00:52:24,202 --> 00:52:27,072
If you don't mind,
I'd just like to ask you a few things.

786
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:33,642
They told me I was completely cured,
but since he's not a real doctor,

787
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:36,082
so I got worried and went back
to the hospital.

788
00:52:37,512 --> 00:52:40,322
Sure enough, I had a relapse.

789
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:45,962
So in other words,
Lee Woo Gyeom's treatment didn't work?

790
00:52:46,462 --> 00:52:47,492
That's right.

791
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:51,592
In time, Sang Woo...

792
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:53,902
will end up just like me.

793
00:52:54,732 --> 00:52:58,102
But after his treatment
from Lee Woo Gyeom,

794
00:52:58,172 --> 00:52:59,802
Sang Woo never received
any hospital treatments.

795
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:06,112
To be clear, you went to the hospital
after Lee Woo Gyeom's supposed cure?

796
00:53:06,242 --> 00:53:07,242
Yes.

797
00:53:08,782 --> 00:53:09,782
So then...

798
00:53:10,782 --> 00:53:13,952
Prosecutor, you can't let the patient
get another procedure.

799
00:53:14,382 --> 00:53:16,652
If it interferes with my methods,

800
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:19,062
he'll never be able to recover.

801
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:28,532
So your condition got worse
when you resumed hospital treatment.

802
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,272
What?

803
00:53:31,672 --> 00:53:33,242
Not because of Lee Woo Gyeom.

804
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,812
Your records and witnesses
have been refuted,

805
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:42,512
- so how can I possibly trust you anymore?
- What I want right now...

806
00:53:43,282 --> 00:53:46,622
is to prove my abilities
so I can treat people who are suffering.

807
00:53:46,882 --> 00:53:49,792
My intentions are good.
Why can't you convey that properly?

808
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:53,862
Because...

809
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:56,292
that's not what you really want.

810
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:58,802
Would someone
with such good intentions...

811
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:01,262
treat the witnesses like garbage?

812
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:05,372
You, be honest with me.

813
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:09,172
Why do you really want to prove yourself?

814
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:12,142
You want me to tell you?

815
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,012
Are you sure you can handle it?
